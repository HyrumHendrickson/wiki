        <strong>Summary</strong>
        Ancient Rome was one of the most powerful and enduring civilizations in human history,
        spanning from its legendary founding in 753 BC to the fall of the Western Empire in
        AD 476. Rome's legal systems, governmental structures, language (Latin), and engineering
        feats shaped Western civilization — and it was the setting for the mortal ministry and
        crucifixion of Jesus Christ, as well as the early Christian Church.

      <h2>The Roman Kingdom and Republic</h2>
      <p>
        According to Roman tradition, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC by the twin brothers
        Romulus and Remus. After a period of kings, Rome became a republic in 509 BC, governed by
        two elected consuls, a Senate, and various assemblies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Roman Republic expanded through military conquest across Italy, then across the
        Mediterranean world — defeating Carthage in the Punic Wars and absorbing Greece, North
        Africa, Spain, and the Near East. Roman law, as developed during the Republic, remains
        the foundation of most modern Western legal systems.

      <h2>The Roman Empire</h2>
      <p>
        After Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Rome was engulfed in civil war. Caesar's adopted
        son Octavian emerged victorious and became <strong>Augustus Caesar</strong>, the first Roman
        Emperor, in 27 BC. Under the Empire, Rome reached its greatest extent, controlling
        territories from Britain to Mesopotamia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The period of the early Empire — the <em>Pax Romana</em> (Roman Peace, roughly 27 BC –
        AD 180) — was one of the most stable and prosperous eras in ancient history. It was during
        this time that Jesus Christ was born (during the reign of Caesar Augustus, Luke 2:1) and
        was crucified (during the governorship of Pontius Pilate).
      </p>

      <h2>Rome and Christianity</h2>
      <p>
        Rome's role in Christian history is profound. The Roman Empire provided:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The road network</strong> — Roman roads allowed Paul and other Apostles to spread the gospel rapidly across the ancient world.</li>
        <li><strong>A common language</strong> — Koine Greek was the <em>lingua franca</em> of the Empire, allowing the New Testament to be written and widely read.</li>
        <li><strong>The legal framework</strong> — Jesus was crucified under Roman law; Paul appealed to his Roman citizenship to defend himself.</li>
        <li><strong>Later patronage</strong> — Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in AD 313 (Edict of Milan), and Emperor Theodosius made it the official state religion in AD 380.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From a Latter-day Saint perspective, the Roman Empire's persecution of Christians ultimately
        contributed to the <strong>Great Apostasy</strong> — the loss of priesthood authority and gospel
        fullness that necessitated the Restoration through Joseph Smith. [1]
      </p>

      <h2>Roman Government and Law</h2>
      <p>
        The Roman system of government — with its Senate, elected magistrates, concept of citizen
        rights, and written law codes — directly inspired the framers of the United States
        Constitution. Latter-day Saints believe the Constitution was inspired of God
        (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 101:80), and its debt to Rome is significant.

            <li><strong>Trial by jury</strong> — judgment by peers</li>
            <li><strong>The Twelve Tables</strong> — Rome's earliest written law code (c. 450 BC)</li>

          </ul>

      <h2>Fall of the Western Empire</h2>
      <p>
        The Western Roman Empire gradually weakened through economic troubles, political instability,
        military pressure from Germanic tribes, and internal corruption. The traditional date for
        the fall is AD 476, when the Germanic chieftain Odoacer deposed the last Western emperor,
        Romulus Augustulus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Eastern Roman Empire</strong> (Byzantine Empire) survived for nearly another
        thousand years, until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Eastern Empire preserved
        Greek learning, Christian theology, and Roman law, passing them to the Renaissance.
      </p>

      <h2>Rome's Enduring Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Few civilizations have had a longer-lasting impact on the world. Modern Western civilization
        is built on Roman foundations: the calendar we use (Julian/Gregorian), the Latin alphabet,
        the Romance languages, the structure of law, and concepts of republic and empire all trace
        back to Rome.
