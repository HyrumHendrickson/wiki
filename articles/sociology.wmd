:::summary
Sociology is the systematic study of human social life — examining how individuals are shaped by, and in turn shape, the groups, institutions, and structures in which they live. From the family and the congregation to the nation-state and the global economy, sociology investigates the invisible architecture of human community. The Christian tradition has its own rich account of social life rooted in covenant, creation, and the nature of the Church as the Body of Christ — an account that both enriches and critiques the findings of empirical sociology.

## What Is Sociology?

Auguste Comte (1798–1857), the French philosopher who coined the word *sociology*, envisioned it as the "queen of sciences" — a discipline that would synthesize knowledge of human social life with the rigor of natural science. Comte's positivism — the insistence that only empirically observable phenomena are legitimate objects of knowledge — set the tone for much subsequent sociological thought, though later thinkers substantially complicated and critiqued this program.

Sociology's classical period (roughly 1870–1920) produced three towering figures whose frameworks still dominate the discipline. **Émile Durkheim** studied social solidarity, collective behavior, and the social functions of religion — famously arguing that religion serves to bind communities together through shared rituals and moral frameworks. His study of suicide demonstrated that even profoundly individual acts are shaped by social forces. **Karl Marx** analyzed society through the lens of class conflict and economic production, arguing that social institutions — including religion — reflect and reinforce the interests of dominant economic classes. **Max Weber** studied the relationship between ideas (especially religious ideas) and social structures, arguing in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (1905) that Protestant theological convictions about vocation and predestination had shaped the distinctive rationalism of modern capitalist society.

## Core Sociological Concepts

**Social structure** refers to the recurring, patterned arrangements that shape individual behavior — social roles, norms, institutions, and status hierarchies. Structural analysis reveals that human behavior is not simply the product of individual choices but is profoundly constrained and enabled by these invisible frameworks.

**Culture** encompasses the shared meanings, symbols, values, norms, and practices that characterize a group or society. Culture is transmitted across generations through socialization — the process by which individuals internalize the values and expectations of their social environment. Religion is one of the most powerful vehicles of cultural transmission in human history.

**Social stratification** describes the hierarchical ranking of individuals and groups in society based on wealth, power, prestige, race, gender, or other attributes. Sociological research consistently demonstrates that social position profoundly affects life outcomes — health, education, longevity, happiness — raising questions of justice that Christian ethics takes with utmost seriousness.

:::dropdown Christian Covenant and Social Life
The Christian tradition offers a rich alternative account of social life rooted not in social contract theory or materialist analysis but in the concept of *covenant*. In the biblical tradition, God does not relate to individuals in isolation but to communities bound to him and to one another by solemn promises. The covenant at Sinai created Israel as a people; the new covenant established through Christ's death and resurrection creates the Church as the Body of Christ.

This covenantal framework has several important sociological implications. First, it insists that human beings are fundamentally social creatures — not autonomous individuals who enter into society by contract but persons who find their identity in relationship. This resonates with Aristotle's definition of man as a *zoon politikon* (political or social animal), which Christian thinkers from Aquinas onward embraced.

Second, covenant implies mutual obligation and accountability — between God and his people, and between members of the covenant community. The Old Testament prophets repeatedly called Israel to account for its treatment of the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger (Isaiah 58; Amos 5; Micah 6:8). This prophetic tradition has powerfully shaped Christian social ethics, from the medieval concept of the "just price" to the twentieth-century Social Gospel movement and Catholic Social Teaching.

Third, covenant creates community that transcends natural bonds — the Church is a family of adopted children of God, drawn from every nation, tribe, and language (Revelation 7:9). This universality is a profound challenge to every form of ethnic, racial, or class-based social exclusion.

In Latter-day Saint thought, the concept of *Zion* represents the highest expression of Christian social vision: a society of persons who are "of one heart and one mind" and among whom "there was no poor" (Moses 7:18). The law of consecration — the principle that members dedicate their surplus to the common good — articulates an economic ethic grounded in covenant solidarity rather than competition.

:::dropdown Religion and Society: Durkheim, Weber, and the Sociological Study of Faith
Sociology and religion have been intertwined from the discipline's origins. Durkheim's *Elementary Forms of the Religious Life* (1912) argued that religion is fundamentally a social phenomenon — that its rituals and beliefs express and reinforce social solidarity, and that "God" is, in effect, society worshipping itself. This reductionist conclusion Christians naturally reject, but Durkheim's empirical observations about the social functions of religion — its role in building community, marking identity, enforcing norms, and consoling in suffering — remain sociologically valid.

Weber's analysis was more nuanced and more sympathetic. His *Protestant Ethic* thesis traced how Calvinist theology's doctrine of predestination generated intense anxiety about one's eternal destiny, which led believers to seek evidence of election in worldly success and diligent labor. This psychological dynamic, Weber argued, contributed to the development of rational capitalism in the Protestant West. Whether or not one accepts this specific thesis, Weber's broader point — that religious ideas have real sociological consequences — is enormously important.

Contemporary sociological research on religion has produced a rich body of findings. Religious practice is associated with higher levels of social trust, charitable giving, volunteerism, and civic participation. Religious communities provide dense social networks that buffer individuals against poverty, isolation, and mental illness. The LDS Church is a particularly striking example of a highly organized religious community with exceptional social capital — dense networks of mutual aid, strong norms of reciprocity, and high rates of volunteerism and charitable giving.

The sociology of religion also raises challenging questions: about the persistence of faith in modern secular societies, about the relationship between religious identity and political behavior, about religious conversion and deconversion, and about the social consequences of religious diversity in pluralistic societies. These are questions that matter enormously for anyone seeking to understand the modern world.

## Sociology and Christian Social Ethics

Max Weber famously worried about the "iron cage" of modernity — the bureaucratic rationalization of social life that strips it of meaning and enchantment. For Christians, the sociological analysis of modern society's alienation, atomization, and anomie resonates with the theological diagnosis of sin as the disruption of right relationship — with God, with neighbor, with creation.

The antidote that Christian social ethics proposes — restored covenant relationship, the practice of solidarity, the preferential option for the poor, the building of genuine community — has concrete sociological dimensions. The Church, at its best, is not only a vehicle of individual salvation but a counter-cultural community that demonstrates an alternative way of living together.
