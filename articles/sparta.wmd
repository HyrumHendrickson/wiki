:::summary
Sparta (also called Lacedaemon) was a powerful Greek city-state renowned for its extraordinary military culture, discipline, and the virtue of its citizens. Sparta's unique social system produced the finest soldiers in the ancient world and made it Athens's great rival for the leadership of Greece. Its ethos of sacrifice, discipline, and civic duty has fascinated and inspired thinkers across the centuries.

## The Spartan System

Sparta's social order was unlike any other in the Greek world. It was structured entirely around military excellence and civic virtue, shaped by the legendary lawgiver **Lycurgus** (dates uncertain, perhaps 9th century BC). The Spartan system included:

:::dropdown The Agoge
The *agoge* was Sparta's rigorous state education system for male citizens. Beginning at age 7, boys were taken from their families and trained in military skills, endurance, discipline, and loyalty to the state. The training was intentionally harsh — exposing boys to hunger, cold, and physical hardship — to produce soldiers who would not break under any conditions.

:::dropdown The Three Classes of Spartan Society
Sparta's population was divided into three groups:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| Spartiates (*homoioi*, "equals") | Full Spartan citizens; professional soldiers; owned land worked by helots |
| Perioeci ("those who dwell around") | Free non-citizens who engaged in trade and crafts; provided auxiliary troops |
| Helots | State-owned serfs who worked Spartan land; mostly conquered Messenians; vastly outnumbered Spartans |

The helot system made Spartan military supremacy possible — Spartiates were free to train full-time because helots did all productive labor. But it also created a permanent threat: the helots far outnumbered the Spartiates and periodically revolted.

:::dropdown Spartan Women
Spartan women enjoyed far more freedom than women in other Greek city-states. They received physical training, managed household estates while men were at war, and were expected to produce and raise strong children. The famous Spartan mother's farewell to her son going to battle: "Come back with your shield — or on it" (*ê tan ê epi tas*) captures the ethos perfectly.

## Thermopylae (480 BC)

The most famous moment in Spartan history came during the Persian Wars. In 480 BC, the Persian Emperor Xerxes invaded Greece with an enormous army. A force of 300 Spartans under King **Leonidas I**, alongside perhaps 7,000 other Greeks, held the narrow pass at Thermopylae for three days against the entire Persian force.

When a traitor revealed a path around the pass, Leonidas dismissed most of the Greek contingents and remained with his 300 Spartans (and others who chose to stay) to cover the Greek retreat. They died to the last man.

The Persian Wars ended in Greek — and particularly Athenian — victory. But the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae became an immortal symbol of courage, sacrifice, and duty — "Go, tell the Spartans, stranger passing by / that here, obedient to their laws, we lie" (Simonides's epigram).

## The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC)

Sparta and Athens — the two dominant powers of Greece — eventually came into direct conflict in the **Peloponnesian War**. Athens's growing empire threatened Spartan supremacy. The war lasted 27 years and ended with Athens's defeat and Sparta's temporary supremacy over Greece.

However, Sparta proved better at war than at governance. Its dominance was short-lived; Thebes defeated Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), ending Spartan hegemony.

## Spartan Virtues and Their Limits

The Spartan ethos — courage, self-discipline, loyalty, endurance — produced qualities that many civilizations have admired. But the Spartan system was built on the brutal exploitation of the helots and was deliberately closed to intellectual, artistic, and philosophical development. While Athens produced Socrates and the Parthenon, Sparta produced warriors.

The contrast between Athens and Sparta has been used throughout Western history to debate the relative values of liberty and discipline, individual excellence and collective duty, culture and military strength.

## Legacy

"Spartan" has entered every major Western language as a synonym for austerity, discipline, and simplicity. The Spartan ideal influenced later thinkers, from Rousseau to the Founding Fathers, who debated what virtues a republic requires. The Spartan story — especially Thermopylae — remains one of the most retold episodes in Western history.
