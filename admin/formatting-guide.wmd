:::notice
**Admin Article** — This reference covers the WMD formatting elements
available in EduWiki articles. For the complete WMD syntax reference, see the
[WMD Format Reference](admin-article.html?id=wmd-reference).
:::

:::summary
EduWiki articles are written in WMD (Wiki Markdown), a plain-text format that is
automatically converted to HTML. This guide covers headings, lists, tables, code blocks,
blockquotes, and all other formatting elements available in `.wmd` files.
:::

## Headings

Use `##` for major sections and `###` for subsections. The Table of Contents is
automatically generated from `##` and `###` headings.

```
## Main Section
### Sub-section
#### Minor sub-section
```

**Rules:**

- Do not use `#` — the article title is always the `<h1>`.
- Use `##` for major sections, `###` for sub-sections.
- Give headings descriptive text (not just "Section 1").

## Text Formatting

Standard inline formatting:

| Syntax | Result | Use for |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `**text**` | **bold** | Key terms, emphasis |
| `*text*` | *italic* | Titles, foreign words |
| `` `text` `` | `monospace` | Code, filenames, commands |
| `~~text~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ | Deleted or corrected text |
| `$E=mc^2$` | inline math | Mathematical expressions |
| `[text](url)` | hyperlink | Links to pages or sites |

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Avoid using forced line breaks —
use new paragraphs instead.

## Lists

Unordered list (bullets):

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Ordered list (numbered):

```
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
```

## Tables

Use GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) table syntax. The separator row is required:

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |
```

Result:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |

## Code Blocks

For multi-line code, wrap in triple backticks. For inline code, use a single backtick.

````
```python
def hello():
    return "world"
```
````

## Blockquotes

Use `>` for notable quotes or callouts:

```
> Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.
> — Galileo Galilei
```

Result:

> Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.
> — Galileo Galilei

## Summary Box

Every article should have a summary box at the top of the content:

```
:::summary
Your 2–4 sentence summary here.
:::
```

## Info Box

The infobox floats on the right side of the content. Use it for quick facts:

```
:::infobox Topic at a Glance
| Field      | Mathematics  |
| Difficulty | Intermediate |
:::
```

## Images

Store images in the `media/` folder. Use the `:::figure` block for proper styling:

```
:::figure ../media/my-image.png | Caption explaining the image.
:::
```

## Links

Internal links (to other articles):

```
[Introduction to Calculus](../articles/article.html?id=calculus)
```

External links (automatically open in a new tab):

```
[Example](https://example.com)
```
