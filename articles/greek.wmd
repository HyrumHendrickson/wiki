:::summary
Ancient Greek is one of the oldest and most influential languages in Western history. It is the language of Homer's epics, Plato's philosophy, and — most crucially for Christians — the New Testament. Koine ("common") Greek was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world during the time of Jesus Christ, and studying Greek opens direct access to the words of Jesus, Paul, and the Apostles as originally recorded.

## The Greek Alphabet

The Greek alphabet has 24 letters and is the ancestor of the Latin (and therefore English) alphabet, as well as the Cyrillic script used in Russian and other Slavic languages. Many Greek letters are used in mathematics, science, and theology:

| Uppercase | Lowercase | Name | Common Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Α | α | Alpha | First; used in physics for angles |
| Β | β | Beta | Second; probability in statistics |
| Γ | γ | Gamma | Gamma rays; Euler–Mascheroni constant |
| Δ | δ | Delta | Change/difference in math and science |
| Π | π | Pi | Ratio of circumference to diameter |
| Σ | σ/ς | Sigma | Summation in mathematics |
| Ω | ω | Omega | "The last"; electrical resistance |

## Periods of Ancient Greek

:::dropdown Archaic and Classical Greek (c. 800–300 BC)
The **Archaic period** gave us Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey* (c. 800 BC), the foundational works of Western literature. The **Classical period** produced the golden age of Athens: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in philosophy; Sophocles and Euripides in drama; Thucydides in history. Classical Attic Greek is considered the most elegant and complex form of the language.

:::dropdown Koine Greek and the New Testament (c. 300 BC – AD 300)
Following Alexander the Great's conquests, a simplified, common form of Greek — **Koine** (κοινή, "common") — spread across the Mediterranean world and became the language of trade, government, and culture. God chose this moment in history to send His Son, ensuring that the gospel could spread rapidly in a common language.

The entire New Testament was written in Koine Greek. Learning even basic Greek allows students to read Matthew, Mark, John, and Paul in their original words — often clarifying meanings that translations can only approximate.

## Greek Words That Matter to Christians

Many key theological concepts come directly from Greek. Understanding the original Greek enriches scripture study:

| Greek Word | Transliteration | Meaning | Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| ἀγάπη | agape | Unconditional love | The highest form of love; God's love for mankind (1 Cor 13) |
| λόγος | logos | Word / Reason | "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1) — Jesus as the Logos |
| εὐαγγέλιον | euangelion | Good news | The "gospel" — the good news of Jesus Christ |
| μετάνοια | metanoia | Change of mind/heart | True repentance — a complete change of direction |
| χάρις | charis | Grace, gift | God's freely given favor; the source of salvation |
| ἐκκλησία | ekklesia | Assembly, called-out ones | The Church — those called out from the world to follow Christ |
| ἀνάστασις | anastasis | Rising up, resurrection | The bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ and all mankind |

## Greek Philosophy and Christian Thought

Greek philosophy — especially Plato and Aristotle — profoundly influenced Christian theology through thinkers like Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Augustine. However, Latter-day Saint theology takes a distinctive approach: while it engages philosophical reasoning, it insists that *revelation* rather than philosophy is the ultimate source of truth about God. [1]

The incorporation of Greek philosophical categories (like "substance," "essence," and "immutability") into early Christian creeds is what Latter-day Saints identify as part of the Apostasy — a movement away from the simple, personal God of scripture toward an abstract philosophical construct.

## Why Study Greek Today?

For any serious student of the New Testament, Greek is an invaluable tool. Even a basic knowledge of Koine Greek allows you to:

- Read the words of Jesus and the Apostles without a translation layer
- Understand why different Bible translations differ
- Catch nuances of meaning in passages that are ambiguous in English
- Engage more deeply with Christian apologetics and theology
