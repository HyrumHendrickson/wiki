:::summary
Human physiology is the science of how the human body works — how its organs, tissues, and cells perform their functions and integrate their activities to sustain life. Where anatomy asks "what is there?", physiology asks "what does it do?" Together they give us a profound picture of the living body as a system of extraordinary complexity, elegance, and purposeful design — one that the Psalmist fittingly described as "fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:14).

## What Is Human Physiology?

Physiology (from Greek *physis*, "nature," and *logos*, "study") investigates the mechanisms by which living organisms function. Human physiology focuses on the processes that enable the human body to live, grow, respond to the environment, and maintain internal stability. It ranges from the molecular level (how enzymes catalyze reactions, how ion channels open and close) through the cellular level (how neurons fire, how muscle fibers contract) to the systemic level (how the cardiovascular and respiratory systems coordinate gas exchange).

Claude Bernard, the nineteenth-century French physiologist, articulated the central principle of physiology: the *milieu intérieur* — the internal environment of the body must remain stable for cells to function. This concept was later named **homeostasis** by Walter Cannon: the body's dynamic tendency to maintain relatively constant internal conditions (temperature, pH, blood glucose, blood pressure) despite constant external changes.

## Homeostasis: The Body's Great Balancing Act

Homeostasis is achieved through **negative feedback loops**: when a variable deviates from its set point, the body detects the change and activates mechanisms that return it to normal. Classic examples:

- **Body temperature:** When core temperature rises, blood vessels dilate and sweat glands activate to dissipate heat; when it falls, shivering and vasoconstriction conserve heat.
- **Blood glucose:** After a meal raises blood glucose, the pancreas secretes **insulin**, driving cells to absorb glucose; between meals, **glucagon** signals the liver to release stored glucose.
- **Blood pressure:** Baroreceptors in major arteries detect pressure changes and signal the heart and blood vessels to adjust output and resistance.

The sophistication of these regulatory systems — involving the nervous system, the endocrine system, the kidneys, the liver, the cardiovascular system, and the immune system simultaneously — illustrates the irreducible integration of the body's design.

:::dropdown The Cardiovascular Physiology
The heart pumps blood through two circuits:
1. **Pulmonary circulation:** Right side of the heart → lungs → left side of the heart. Blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
2. **Systemic circulation:** Left side of the heart → body → right side of the heart. Oxygenated blood delivers oxygen and nutrients; deoxygenated blood returns with carbon dioxide and waste.

The cardiac cycle — coordinated by the heart's own electrical conduction system (the sinoatrial node, or "natural pacemaker") — ensures that the four chambers contract in the correct sequence. The heart rate and stroke volume together determine **cardiac output**: the volume of blood pumped per minute. At rest this is about 5 liters/minute; during intense exercise it may exceed 20 liters/minute in a trained athlete.

Blood pressure — measured as systolic (contraction) over diastolic (relaxation) — reflects both the force of the heart and the resistance of blood vessels. Chronic hypertension damages arterial walls and strains the heart, while chronic hypotension impairs tissue perfusion. Maintaining healthy blood pressure is one of the most important determinants of long-term cardiovascular health.

## The Respiratory System

Every cell in the body requires oxygen for ATP production and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. The respiratory system manages this gas exchange:

- **Ventilation:** The diaphragm and intercostal muscles create pressure changes that draw air into and push it out of the lungs.
- **Gas exchange in the alveoli:** Oxygen diffuses from the air sacs into the blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli.
- **Gas transport:** Hemoglobin in red blood cells binds oxygen for delivery to tissues.
- **Regulation:** The brainstem monitors blood CO₂ levels and adjusts breathing rate to maintain pH.

The lungs contain approximately **300 million alveoli**, providing a gas-exchange surface area of roughly 70 square meters — about the size of a tennis court — folded into a space smaller than a football. This architectural achievement is a favorite example in discussions of biological design.

## The Endocrine System and Hormones

The endocrine system communicates through **hormones** — chemical messengers released into the bloodstream that regulate distant target organs. Major endocrine glands include:

- **Hypothalamus** — master regulator, integrating nervous and endocrine signaling
- **Pituitary** — the "master gland," releasing hormones that control other glands
- **Thyroid** — regulates metabolism via thyroxine
- **Adrenal glands** — produce cortisol (stress response) and adrenaline (fight-or-flight)
- **Pancreas** — insulin and glucagon for blood glucose regulation
- **Gonads** (testes, ovaries) — sex hormones governing reproduction and secondary sex characteristics

The intricate feedback loops of the endocrine system — where a hormone from the pituitary stimulates a peripheral gland, which releases a hormone that feeds back to inhibit the pituitary — represent some of the most elegant regulatory circuits in biology.

## The Digestive and Urinary Systems

**Digestion** transforms food into absorbable nutrients:
1. **Mechanical breakdown** begins in the mouth (chewing) and continues in the stomach (churning).
2. **Chemical breakdown** involves enzymes from the salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, and small intestine.
3. **Absorption** occurs primarily in the small intestine, whose surface area is vastly increased by villi and microvilli.
4. **Elimination** of waste occurs through the large intestine.

The **urinary system** — kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra — filters blood to remove metabolic waste (particularly urea from protein metabolism), regulates water and electrolyte balance, and maintains blood pH. The kidneys filter approximately 180 liters of blood per day, producing about 1.5 liters of urine.

## Physiology and Christian Living

The Latter-day Saint revelation known as the Word of Wisdom (Doctrine and Covenants 89) offers dietary and lifestyle counsel whose physiological wisdom has been increasingly validated by modern science. The apostle Paul's statement that the body is a "temple of the Holy Spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:19–20) gives Christian living a somatic dimension: we honor God with our bodies through exercise, sleep, wholesome food, and avoidance of substances that damage the systems God designed.
