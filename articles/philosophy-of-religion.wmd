:::summary
Philosophy of religion is the philosophical examination of religious beliefs, practices, and experience. It asks whether belief in God is rational, whether arguments for God's existence succeed, how to reconcile God's goodness with the reality of evil, and how religious language can be meaningful. Standing at the intersection of reason and faith, it is one of the oldest and most vital fields of philosophical inquiry.

## What Is Philosophy of Religion?

Philosophy of religion applies the tools of philosophical reasoning — argument, conceptual analysis, and critical evaluation — to the claims and practices of religion. Unlike theology, which typically proceeds from within a faith commitment, philosophy of religion examines religious claims from a perspective that is (in principle) accessible to believers and non-believers alike.

Its major areas include:

- **Natural theology**: Can we prove God's existence by reason alone, without appeal to scripture or revelation?
- **Religious epistemology**: Can religious belief be rational? What role does faith play?
- **The problem of evil**: How can a good, all-powerful God permit suffering?
- **Divine attributes**: What does it mean to say God is omniscient, omnipotent, or omnibenevolent?
- **Religious language**: How can finite human language describe an infinite, transcendent God?
- **Miracles and religious experience**: Are miracles possible? Can religious experience serve as evidence?

## Arguments for the Existence of God

:::dropdown The Cosmological Argument
The cosmological argument infers the existence of God from the existence of the world. The most famous version is Aquinas's "Five Ways" (from his *Summa Theologica*):

1. **From motion**: Everything that moves is moved by something else; this cannot regress infinitely; therefore, there is an unmoved mover.
2. **From efficient causation**: Nothing causes itself; causal chains cannot be infinite; therefore, there is a first cause.
3. **From contingency**: Contingent things (which might not have existed) depend on necessary things for their existence; if everything were contingent, nothing would now exist; therefore, there is a necessary being.

The **Kalam Cosmological Argument** (developed by Islamic philosophers al-Kindi and al-Ghazali, revived by William Lane Craig): Whatever begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist (confirmed by the Big Bang); therefore, the universe has a cause — and this cause must be timeless, spaceless, immensely powerful, and personal.

Criticisms: Why can't the universe itself be the necessary or uncaused being? Does "cause" apply beyond the universe?

:::dropdown The Teleological Argument (Argument from Design)
The teleological argument argues from evidence of purpose and order in the world to a designing intelligence. William Paley's famous watchmaker analogy (1802): if you found a watch on a heath, you would infer a watchmaker — because the complexity and purposiveness of the watch's parts could not arise by chance. The universe's complexity similarly points to a divine designer.

The argument has been developed in modern form as the **Fine-Tuning Argument**: the fundamental constants of physics (the strength of gravity, the mass of electrons, etc.) are precisely calibrated to permit life. The probability of this occurring by chance is astronomically small. This fine-tuning is best explained by a designing intelligence.

Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection undermined Paley's version (biological complexity can arise through undirected evolution), but the fine-tuning argument operates at a more fundamental level — before biology begins — and is widely debated among philosophers and scientists.

:::dropdown The Ontological Argument
The ontological argument, first formulated by Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109), attempts to prove God's existence from the very concept of God alone — without appeal to the external world.

Anselm's version: God is "that than which nothing greater can be conceived." If God existed only as an idea, we could conceive of something greater — a being that exists in reality as well as in the mind. Therefore, God must exist in reality.

Kant's famous objection: "existence is not a predicate." Saying something exists does not add a property to it; existence is not a feature that makes things greater or lesser.

Modal versions (Plantinga): If it is *possible* that a maximally great being exists, then such a being exists in some possible world. A maximally great being must exist in all possible worlds (since a being that exists necessarily is greater than one that exists contingently). Therefore, if such a being is possible, it exists necessarily — and hence actually.

:::dropdown The Problem of Evil
The most powerful argument *against* theism is the problem of evil. It comes in two forms:

**The logical problem** (Mackie): An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God would prevent all evil. Evil exists. Therefore, no such God exists. The three properties are logically inconsistent with evil's existence.

**The evidential problem** (Rowe): Even if evil does not *prove* that God does not exist, the amount and distribution of apparently gratuitous suffering (the suffering of innocent animals, the pain of children with terminal diseases) constitutes significant evidence against theism.

Key responses:
- **The Free Will Defense** (Plantinga): God cannot create free beings and also guarantee they never do evil. The existence of moral evil is the price of genuine freedom.
- **The Soul-Making Theodicy** (Hick): A world without challenges, pain, or adversity would prevent the development of character, virtue, and spiritual maturity.
- **Skeptical Theism** (Wykstra, Bergmann): We should not expect to be able to discern God's reasons for permitting particular evils. Just as a child cannot understand why a loving parent allows certain painful medical procedures, we cannot expect to see the full picture of divine providence.

Latter-day Saint theodicy has distinctive resources: God the Father is himself a glorified, embodied being who has passed through the mortal experience; suffering is part of a plan of progression in which opposition is necessary for growth (2 Nephi 2:11).

## Religious Experience

William James's *The Varieties of Religious Experience* (1902) documented the diversity and psychological power of religious experiences. Can such experiences serve as evidence for God's existence?

Richard Swinburne's **Principle of Credulity**: In the absence of special reasons for doubt, we should accept experiences at face value — including religious experiences. If it seems to someone that they are in the presence of God, then probably they are.

Critics: Religious experiences vary dramatically across cultures; they can be induced by drugs or brain stimulation; their content reflects the believer's expectations. Defenders respond that these facts do not automatically discredit religious experience any more than the variability and fallibility of perception discredits perceptual experience.
