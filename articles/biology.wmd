:::summary
Biology is the scientific study of living organisms — from the smallest bacterium to the tallest redwood, from the chemistry of a single cell to the dynamics of a global ecosystem. As the science of life, it stands at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and the deepest questions of existence. For Christians, biology is an exploration of God's most extraordinary work: living creatures made, as Genesis declares, "after their kind," bearing the imprint of a brilliant and purposeful Creator.

## What Is Biology?

The word *biology* comes from the Greek *bios* (life) and *logos* (study). It is the branch of natural science that investigates the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things. Life, for all its staggering diversity, shares a remarkable set of common features: cells as the basic unit of structure and function, DNA as the carrier of hereditary information, metabolism as the means of energy transformation, and reproduction as the means of continuity.

Modern biology is organized into many sub-disciplines. **Molecular biology** examines life at the level of DNA, RNA, and proteins. **Cell biology** studies the structure and function of individual cells. **Genetics** investigates heredity and variation. **Evolutionary biology** examines how species change over time. **Ecology** studies the relationships of organisms with each other and with their environments. **Physiology** explores how organisms function. Each of these fields enriches our understanding of the intricate design woven through living creation.

## The Cell: Life's Basic Unit

The cell theory, formalized in the nineteenth century by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, establishes that all living organisms are composed of cells, that the cell is the basic unit of life, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This insight was revolutionary and remains foundational to every area of biology.

Cells come in two basic types:
- **Prokaryotic cells** (bacteria and archaea) lack a membrane-bound nucleus and are structurally simpler.
- **Eukaryotic cells** (plants, animals, fungi, and protists) contain a nucleus and numerous membrane-bound organelles.

Within a eukaryotic cell, the **nucleus** houses the cell's DNA; **mitochondria** generate ATP through cellular respiration; **ribosomes** synthesize proteins; the **endoplasmic reticulum** and **Golgi apparatus** process and package proteins; **chloroplasts** (in plant cells) carry out photosynthesis. The extraordinary complexity and coordination of these organelles points to what theologians call the *argument from biological complexity* — the evidence of purposeful design within even the simplest cell.

:::dropdown Genetics and the Language of DNA
The discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins in 1953 transformed biology. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) encodes hereditary information in a four-letter chemical alphabet (A, T, G, C). Segments of DNA called **genes** encode instructions for building proteins, which perform virtually every function in a living organism.

The field of **genetics** began with Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian friar who carefully studied pea plants in the 1860s and discovered the mathematical laws governing the inheritance of discrete traits. Mendel's work — combining careful observation, controlled experimentation, and mathematical analysis — exemplifies the best of the scientific tradition.

Modern genomics has revealed that the human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs encoding around 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genetic code is nearly universal across all living organisms — a profound testimony to the common biological heritage of all life and, for those with eyes to see, to the unified creative vision of God.

## Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration

Two of the most important biochemical processes in biology are **photosynthesis** and **cellular respiration** — together they form the engine of life on Earth.

**Photosynthesis** occurs in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, these organisms produce glucose and oxygen. The overall equation is:

> 6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂

This process forms the base of nearly every food chain on Earth and maintains the atmosphere's oxygen supply. It is, quite literally, the mechanism by which the sun's energy is captured and made available to life — a process of breathtaking elegance.

**Cellular respiration** is essentially the reverse: organisms break down glucose to release the energy stored in its chemical bonds, producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate) — the universal energy currency of the cell. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and yields far more ATP than anaerobic alternatives.

## Evolutionary Biology

The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858 and elaborated in Darwin's *On the Origin of Species* (1859), is the central organizing framework of modern biology. It proposes that:
1. Organisms produce more offspring than survive.
2. Offspring vary in heritable traits.
3. Some variants survive and reproduce better than others.
4. Over time, favorable traits accumulate, and populations change.

Christians hold a spectrum of views on evolution and creation. Many affirm that God used evolutionary processes as his means of creation; others hold to special creation; still others find the question genuinely open. What is not in dispute is the theological commitment that life — in all its extraordinary complexity and beauty — is ultimately a gift from a creative and purposeful God, not a brute accident.

:::dropdown The Kingdoms of Life
Biologists classify life into hierarchical categories. The broadest division (domain) distinguishes *Bacteria*, *Archaea*, and *Eukarya*. Within Eukarya, the traditional kingdoms include:

- **Animalia** — multicellular, heterotrophic organisms (including humans)
- **Plantae** — multicellular, photosynthetic organisms
- **Fungi** — decomposers and absorptive heterotrophs (mushrooms, yeasts, molds)
- **Protista** — a diverse group of mostly unicellular eukaryotes

Modern phylogenetics uses DNA sequence data to construct evolutionary "trees of life" that reveal the deep relationships among organisms. The resulting picture is one of extraordinary interconnectedness — the same basic molecular machinery (DNA replication, ribosomal translation, ATP synthesis) running through every living thing on Earth.

## Biology and the Christian Faith

Christians have always been curious about the natural world. From Aristotle's biology to the medieval bestiaries to Francis Bacon's call for the study of the "Book of Nature," natural inquiry has been understood as a form of glorifying God. The Bible's first chapters describe God as Creator who brings forth living creatures "after their kind" and culminates in the creation of human beings in the *imago Dei* — the image of God (Genesis 1:26–27).

Psalm 139:14 declares, "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well." This verse captures the spirit with which a Christian approaches biological study: awe at the craftsmanship, gratitude toward the Craftsman.
