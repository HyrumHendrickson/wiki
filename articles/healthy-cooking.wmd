:::summary
Healthy cooking is both a practical skill and a profound act of stewardship — the art of preparing wholesome, nourishing food in ways that honor the body God gave us, the people we share our table with, and the earth from which our food comes. From Daniel's "pulse and water" to the Latter-day Saint Word of Wisdom, Scripture consistently commends simple, wholesome food as an expression of wisdom, discipline, and gratitude to God.

## Why Cooking Matters

Cooking is one of the defining activities of human civilization. Anthropologist Richard Wrangham has argued that the control of fire for cooking was a pivotal turning point in human evolution — enabling greater caloric extraction from food, reducing the energy cost of digestion, and freeing cognitive and social time for other pursuits. Long before modern nutritional science, human cultures accumulated millennia of wisdom about which foods promote health and which harm it — wisdom encoded in culinary traditions, dietary laws, and religious practice.

The Christian tradition brings a theological dimension to the kitchen. Paul's statement that the body is a "temple of the Holy Spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:19–20) calls believers to care for their physical selves with the same reverence they would bring to sacred space. Healthy cooking is one of the most practical and daily expressions of this stewardship.

## Core Principles of Healthy Cooking

### Choose Whole, Minimally Processed Foods

The most consistently supported principle in nutritional science is the superiority of whole foods — foods that are close to their natural state — over heavily processed alternatives. Processing strips foods of fiber, vitamins, and minerals while adding sugar, salt, refined starch, and industrial fats. A meal built around whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and quality proteins is nutritionally far superior to one dominated by packaged, shelf-stable products.

The Word of Wisdom's counsel — to use "herbs," "fruit," and "grain" (particularly "wheat for man") as dietary staples, with meat used "sparingly" — aligns with what large epidemiological studies consistently find: plant-centered diets are associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

### Cook with Healthy Fats

Not all fats are equal. Replacing saturated and trans fats with **unsaturated fats** (olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, fatty fish) has clear cardiovascular benefits. Extra-virgin olive oil — the cornerstone fat of the Mediterranean diet — is rich in **oleocanthal**, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties. Butter and animal fats used in moderation are not inherently harmful for most people; industrially produced trans fats, however, should be avoided entirely.

### Preserve Nutrients Through Cooking Methods

Cooking methods significantly affect nutritional value:

| Method | Nutrients Retained | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Steaming | High (water-soluble vitamins preserved) | Vegetables |
| Roasting | Moderate–High | Roots, meats, legumes |
| Sautéing | High (quick cook time) | Greens, proteins |
| Boiling | Lower (leaches water-soluble vitamins) | Soups (retain cooking liquid) |
| Raw preparation | Highest | Salads, fruits |

Brief cooking times, minimal water, and lower temperatures generally preserve more vitamins and phytonutrients than prolonged high-heat methods.

:::dropdown The Mediterranean Diet
The Mediterranean diet — based on the traditional eating patterns of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea — is among the most thoroughly studied and consistently endorsed dietary patterns in nutritional science. It emphasizes:

- Abundant vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes
- Olive oil as the primary fat
- Moderate fish and seafood (at least twice per week)
- Moderate dairy (primarily yogurt and cheese)
- Moderate poultry and eggs
- Limited red meat
- Red wine in moderation (optional; omitted by those following the Word of Wisdom)
- Abundant herbs and spices

The landmark PREDIMED trial (2013) found that a Mediterranean-style diet supplemented with olive oil or nuts reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 30% compared to a low-fat control diet. Subsequent research has confirmed benefits for cognitive health, cancer prevention, and metabolic disorders.

The Mediterranean diet is not merely a modern health prescription — it reflects the ancient dietary wisdom of the civilizations that produced the Bible, the great philosophers, and the foundations of Western thought. Vegetables, legumes, fish, olive oil, and bread have nourished civilized humanity for millennia.

## Practical Healthy Cooking Strategies

**Batch cooking** — preparing large quantities of grains, legumes, and vegetables at the start of the week — dramatically reduces the temptation to resort to processed convenience foods on busy days.

**Herbs and spices** are among the most powerful tools in healthy cooking. They add flavor without sodium, sugar, or fat, and many carry significant health-promoting properties: turmeric (anti-inflammatory), garlic (cardiovascular), ginger (digestive), cinnamon (blood glucose modulation).

**Reading labels** is essential when purchasing packaged foods. Look for short ingredient lists, recognize added sugars (listed under many names: corn syrup, dextrose, maltose, etc.), and avoid partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats).

**Cooking from scratch** — using whole ingredients rather than packaged mixes or frozen meals — is the single most effective way to control what goes into your food. It is also substantially less expensive and develops practical skills that were once considered essential to household management.

## The Family Table

The act of eating together is far more than nutrition — it is community, culture, and in the Christian tradition, a foretaste of the heavenly banquet. Jesus chose the table as the setting for his most intimate moments with his disciples. The Eucharist itself is a meal. The family dinner, cooked with care and shared with love, enacts the values of hospitality, gratitude, and fellowship that are central to the Christian life.

Teaching children to cook is an act of discipleship — passing on skills, values, and the knowledge of how to care for the bodies God entrusted to us.
