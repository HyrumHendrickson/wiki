:::summary
Ecology is the branch of biology that studies the relationships between living organisms and their environments — including relationships among organisms themselves and between organisms and the physical world. Founded as a distinct discipline in the nineteenth century, ecology addresses questions ranging from the interactions of individual organisms with their habitat to the functioning of entire biospheres. For Christians, ecology is inseparable from the doctrine of creation: God made the natural world, pronounced it good, and charged humanity with its faithful stewardship.

## What Is Ecology?

The word *ecology* derives from the Greek *oikos* (household) and *logos* (study) — it is, literally, the science of the "household" of nature. Ernst Haeckel coined the term in 1866 to describe "the whole science of the relations of the organism to the environment." Since then, ecology has grown into one of the most comprehensive and consequential fields of scientific inquiry.

Ecology is organized at several levels. **Population ecology** studies groups of the same species — their size, density, growth rates, and the factors that regulate them. **Community ecology** examines interactions among different species sharing a habitat: predation, competition, mutualism, parasitism, and symbiosis. **Ecosystem ecology** focuses on the flows of energy and nutrients through biological and physical systems, including processes like photosynthesis, decomposition, the nitrogen cycle, and the water cycle. **Biome ecology** studies large-scale geographic communities (rainforests, grasslands, deserts, tundra) defined by climate and dominant vegetation.

## Key Ecological Concepts

**Biodiversity** — the variety of life at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels — is widely recognized as a measure of ecological health. Diverse ecosystems are more resilient: they can absorb disturbances and recover from stress more effectively than simplified ones. The ongoing mass extinction driven by habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species, and climate change represents a profound loss of the living heritage of Earth.

**Food webs** describe the transfer of energy through an ecosystem, from producers (photosynthetic plants and algae) through primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (predators), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria). Every link in a food web represents a relationship of dependence — a reminder that no organism exists in isolation.

**Carrying capacity** is the maximum population size an environment can sustain indefinitely given its available resources. When a population exceeds its carrying capacity, it degrades the resources on which it depends — a pattern with direct relevance to human civilization and its demands on the global environment.

**Ecological succession** describes the predictable sequence of changes in a community over time — from bare rock or disturbed ground through pioneer species, shrub communities, and ultimately stable climax communities. Succession reveals that ecological systems are not static but dynamic and directional.

:::dropdown Christian Stewardship and Creation Care
The opening chapters of Genesis establish the theological framework for the Christian understanding of the natural world. God creates the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1), pronounces each stage of creation "good" (1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25), and culminates with the creation of humanity in his image (1:26–27). Crucially, the mandate given to humanity — *dominion* over the earth (1:28) — is immediately contextualized in chapter 2 by the command to "dress and keep" the garden (2:15). The Hebrew words (*abad*, to serve or till; *shamar*, to keep or guard) suggest not domination but responsible care — the role of a steward, not an owner.

Psalm 24:1 makes the ownership explicit: "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof." Humans hold the natural world in trust, not as proprietors but as caretakers accountable to God. This understanding — often called the *stewardship* ethic — provides the theological foundation for Christian environmentalism.

In the Latter-day Saint tradition, D&C 59:18–20 states that the abundance of the earth was created "for the benefit and use of man... to please the eye and to gladden the heart... for taste and for smell... and it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this purpose were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess." The qualifier "with judgment, not to excess" is significant — it establishes a principle of restrained, grateful use rather than unlimited exploitation.

Modern ecological thinkers within Christianity have developed this tradition into what is sometimes called "creation care" — the view that environmental protection is a Christian moral obligation. Pope Francis's encyclical *Laudato Si'* (2015) is one of the most extensive magisterial documents on ecology, calling for "an integral ecology" that connects care for the earth with care for the poor.

:::dropdown Alexander von Humboldt and the Holistic Vision of Nature
The intellectual ancestor of modern ecology is often identified as Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), the Prussian naturalist whose revolutionary insight was that nature is a unified web of interacting forces rather than a collection of isolated objects. Traveling through South America in the early 1800s, Humboldt observed how altitude, temperature, vegetation, and animal life were interconnected — the same species distributions appeared on different mountains around the world because the same ecological relationships were at work.

Humboldt's vision was both scientific and spiritual. He wrote of the "web of life" long before that phrase became common, and he sensed in the beauty and order of nature something that transcended mere mechanism. His great work *Cosmos* attempted a unified description of the physical universe from nebulae to mosses, animated by the conviction that nature's diversity expressed an underlying unity.

This holistic vision resonates deeply with the Christian conviction that creation is an expression of divine wisdom and order — that the intricate interdependencies of ecosystems reflect the intelligence of a Creator who made all things well. The ecologist Aldo Leopold, though not a orthodox Christian, captured a similar moral vision in his "Land Ethic": "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." For Christians, this ethic finds its deepest grounding not in aesthetics alone but in the recognition that the "biotic community" is God's household.

## Ecology and Human Civilization

Human civilization is, in ecological terms, a massive experiment in the modification of natural systems. Agriculture replaced diverse ecosystems with simplified ones; cities concentrated population and waste; industrialization released carbon stored over millions of years into the atmosphere in centuries. The resulting pressures — climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification, freshwater depletion — constitute the most significant ecological disruption in the history of Homo sapiens.

The science of ecology provides the analytical tools to understand these pressures and design more sustainable ways of living. The Christian tradition provides the moral vocabulary — stewardship, responsibility, justice — to motivate and guide the necessary change.
