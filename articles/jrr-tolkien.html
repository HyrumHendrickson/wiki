        <strong>Summary</strong>
        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was an English author, poet, and Oxford professor
        whose Catholic Christian faith and love of language and myth gave the world one of the
        greatest literary achievements of the 20th century: the mythology of Middle-earth,
        including <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Tolkien believed that
        human storytelling — "sub-creation" — participates in the creative work of God.

      <h2>Life and Formation</h2>
      <p>
        Tolkien was born in South Africa but raised in England. He lost his father at age four and
        his mother, Mabel, when he was twelve — she died after converting to Roman Catholicism,
        a faith she had found to be true despite enormous family pressure against it. Tolkien was
        deeply shaped by his mother's sacrifice for her faith and remained a devout Catholic
        throughout his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        He studied at Exeter College, Oxford, served in World War I (including the Battle of the
        Somme), and eventually became a professor at Oxford, where he spent most of his career.
        His academic specialty was <strong>Old English and Germanic philology</strong>, which
        directly fed his mythological imagination.
      </p>

      <h2>The Inklings</h2>
      <p>
        Tolkien was a founding member of the <strong>Inklings</strong> — an informal literary
        group at Oxford whose members included C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, and
        others. The Inklings met regularly to read and critique each other's work. Tolkien's
        persuasive arguments about myth and Christianity played a crucial role in C.S. Lewis's
        conversion from atheism to Christianity in 1931. [1]

          📖 The Hobbit (1937)
        </button>
        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Originally written to entertain Tolkien's children, <em>The Hobbit</em> introduces
            Bilbo Baggins, a comfortable hobbit who is drawn out of his safe home into a great
            adventure by the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves. The themes of reluctant
            heroism, the value of home and simple virtues, and the providence that guides small
            creatures to accomplish great things are all deeply present.

      <div class="wiki-dropdown">
        <button class="wiki-dropdown-trigger" type="button">
          📖 The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955)
        </button>
        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Tolkien's masterwork follows Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring in their
            quest to destroy the One Ring. At its heart, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is a story
            about temptation, sacrifice, friendship, and eucatastrophe — Tolkien's term for the
            sudden turn from grief to joy that he saw as the hallmark of the Christian gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tolkien explicitly connected eucatastrophe to the Resurrection of Christ:
            <em>"The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. The Resurrection
            is the eucatastrophe of the story of the Incarnation."</em>

        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Tolkien's mythological creation story for Middle-earth. It begins with
            <em>Ainulindalë</em> ("The Music of the Ainur"), in which the one God, Ilúvatar,
            creates the world through music with angelic beings. This creation myth is one of
            the most beautiful and theologically resonant in modern literature — and its themes
            of creation, rebellion, free agency, and redemption echo Christian and even Latter-day
            Saint cosmology.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Faith and Sub-creation</h2>
      <p>
        Tolkien's famous essay <em>"On Fairy-Stories"</em> (1947) argues that human beings, as
        beings made in the image of a Creator God, have a God-given impulse to <strong>sub-create</strong>
        — to make secondary worlds with their own internal consistency and beauty. This is not
        escapism; it is a participation in the creativity of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view resonates with Latter-day Saint theology, which teaches that we are literal
        spirit children of a God who creates, and that creativity, beauty, and artistic excellence
        are divine attributes to be cultivated. Tolkien's insistence that great art must have
        moral depth and point toward truth is a principle that aligns well with the gospel.
      </p>

      <h2>Tolkien's Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Tolkien was a philologist — a lover of language — and invented multiple complete languages
        for Middle-earth, including <strong>Quenya</strong> and <strong>Sindarin</strong> (Elvish).
        His languages drew on Finnish, Welsh, Old English, Gothic, and other real languages.
        The depth of linguistic invention in Middle-earth is without parallel in literary history.
