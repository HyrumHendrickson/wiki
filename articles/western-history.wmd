:::summary
Western history is the story of the civilizations that grew from ancient Greece and Rome, passed through the crucible of Christian Europe, and produced the modern world. It is a story of ideas — democracy, philosophy, monotheism, science, and individual rights — that have shaped every nation on earth. For Latter-day Saints, Western history is also the providential stage on which the Restoration of the gospel took place.

## The Ancient World (c. 3000 BC – 500 AD)

Western civilization has deep roots in the ancient Near East — Mesopotamia (Sumer, Babylon, Assyria) and Egypt — but its most direct ancestors are ancient Greece and Rome.

:::dropdown Ancient Greece (c. 800–323 BC)
Greece gave the West its philosophical tradition, its first democratic governments, its literary and dramatic forms, and much of its scientific vocabulary. The city-states of Athens and Sparta, the philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the poets Homer and Hesiod — all emerged from this small peninsula over a period of roughly four centuries.

Greek culture was spread across the known world by Alexander the Great (336–323 BC), creating the Hellenistic world that became the cultural setting of the New Testament.

:::dropdown Ancient Rome (c. 753 BC – 476 AD)
Rome inherited Greek culture and gave it political structure, legal rigor, and administrative organization. The Roman Republic and Empire created a system of law, roads, and common language (Latin) that unified the Mediterranean world. It was into the Roman Empire's *Pax Romana* that Jesus Christ was born, and through Rome's road network and the Greek *lingua franca* that the gospel spread to the ends of the earth.

## The Medieval World (c. 500–1400 AD)

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Western Europe entered a period of fragmentation, gradual Christianization, and the development of new institutions.

| Development | Description |
|---|---|
| The Christian Church | Became the primary unifying institution of Western Europe |
| Monasteries | Centers of learning, agriculture, and manuscript preservation |
| Feudalism | The political and economic system of medieval Europe |
| The Crusades (1095–1291) | Religious wars to recover the Holy Land; shaped Christian-Muslim relations |
| Scholasticism | The intellectual movement synthesizing Christian theology and Aristotelian philosophy (Aquinas) |

From a Latter-day Saint perspective, the medieval period was also the time of the **Great Apostasy** — when the loss of priesthood authority and the mixing of Christianity with Greek philosophy produced doctrines that departed from the original gospel.

## The Renaissance and Reformation (c. 1300–1600)

The Renaissance ("rebirth") began in Italy and spread across Europe, reviving classical learning, producing masterpieces of art and literature, and turning attention back to the individual human person.

The Protestant Reformation, begun by Martin Luther in 1517, broke the religious unity of Western Europe and reasserted the authority of scripture. From a Latter-day Saint perspective, these developments were providential:

- They broke the monopoly of a single institution on Christian truth
- They spread the Bible in vernacular languages
- They created the religious pluralism in which the Restoration could take root

## The Enlightenment and the American Founding (c. 1650–1800)

The scientific revolution (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton) and the Enlightenment (Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau) transformed Western thought, emphasizing reason, individual rights, and the limits of government. These ideas shaped the American founding directly.

Latter-day Saints believe the United States Constitution was **inspired of God** (D&C 101:77–80) — that the freedoms it established were providential preparation for the Restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith in 1830. Without the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Restoration as it happened could not have occurred.

## The Modern World (c. 1800–Present)

Western history's modern period — the industrial revolution, the world wars, the Cold War, and the information age — has brought both extraordinary progress and catastrophic violence. The 20th century's world wars, the Holocaust, and other atrocities demonstrate that civilization and technology without moral grounding do not produce human flourishing.

## The LDS Perspective on Western History

For Latter-day Saints, Western history is not merely the story of human progress — it is a providential narrative in which God prepared the world for the Restoration:

1. **Greece** provided philosophy, logic, and the Koine Greek language for the New Testament
2. **Rome** provided roads, political unity, and law — enabling the gospel's first spread
3. **The Apostasy** prompted the need for the Restoration
4. **The Reformation** broke Rome's monopoly and created religious freedom
5. **The Enlightenment** produced the American constitutional order
6. **The Restoration** through Joseph Smith completed what Providence had prepared
