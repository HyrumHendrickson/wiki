:::summary
The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a transformative cultural and intellectual movement that began in Italy in the 14th century and spread across Europe by the 16th century. It marked the transition from the medieval world to the modern era, characterized by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman learning, a celebration of human potential (*humanism*), revolutionary developments in art and architecture, and the beginnings of modern science. The Renaissance prepared the ground for both the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.

## What Was the Renaissance?

The word "renaissance" is French for "rebirth" — a rebirth of classical learning, culture, and values that had been suppressed or forgotten during the medieval period. Renaissance thinkers looked back to ancient Greece and Rome as models of human achievement and sought to recover, imitate, and surpass them.

The Renaissance began in Italy — especially Florence — for several reasons:

- Italy had direct contact with the Byzantine Empire, which had preserved classical Greek texts
- Italian city-states like Florence, Venice, and Milan were wealthy from trade and patronized the arts
- The fall of Constantinople (1453) brought Greek scholars and manuscripts to Italy
- Italian humanists had already begun rediscovering classical Latin texts in the 14th century

## Italian Renaissance (1300–1527)

### Petrarch and the Humanist Movement

Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374) is often called the "first humanist." He believed medieval scholars had neglected the great achievements of classical antiquity and set about recovering and studying ancient Latin texts. He called the medieval period the "Dark Ages" — a label that has stuck (though modern historians are more nuanced).

Humanism — the intellectual movement at the heart of the Renaissance — emphasized:

- The dignity and potential of human beings
- The study of classical literature, history, philosophy, and rhetoric (*studia humanitatis*)
- Active civic life rather than monastic withdrawal
- Individual achievement and fame

### Florence and the Medici

Florence was the cradle of the Italian Renaissance, largely due to the patronage of the **Medici family** — wealthy bankers who funded artists, architects, and scholars. The Medici circle included Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo.

Cosimo de' Medici (1389–1464) established the Platonic Academy in Florence, which studied Plato and Neo-Platonic philosophy and sought to reconcile classical thought with Christianity.

### Art and Architecture

Renaissance art was transformed by:

- **Linear perspective** (Brunelleschi, ~1415): A geometric method for depicting three-dimensional space on a flat surface, creating the illusion of depth
- **Study of classical antiquity:** Sculptors and architects studied ancient Roman buildings and statues
- **Anatomical accuracy:** Artists, especially Leonardo, dissected human bodies to understand anatomy
- **Individual portraits and psychological depth:** The subject became fully human, not merely symbolic

Key works:
- Brunelleschi's dome of Florence Cathedral (1436) — an engineering marvel
- Donatello's *David* — the first free-standing nude sculpture since antiquity
- Botticelli's *Birth of Venus* (c. 1485)
- Leonardo da Vinci's *Mona Lisa* (c. 1503–1519) and *The Last Supper* (1495–1498)
- Michelangelo's *David* (1504) and the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–1512)
- Raphael's *School of Athens* (1509–1511) — a tribute to ancient philosophy

### Literature

- Dante's *Divine Comedy* (early 14th century) — though pre-Renaissance, it established Italian as a literary language
- Boccaccio's *Decameron* — humanist, earthly stories of human life
- Machiavelli's *The Prince* (1513) — a realistic analysis of political power

## Northern Renaissance (c. 1450–1600)

The Renaissance spread north through trade, printing, and the movement of scholars. Key developments:

### The Printing Press

Johannes Gutenberg's printing press (c. 1440) was the Renaissance's most transformative technology. It enabled:
- Mass production of books and pamphlets
- Rapid spread of new ideas (including the Reformation)
- The first accurate reproduction of classical texts
- Wider literacy

### Erasmus and Christian Humanism

Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536) exemplified the Northern Renaissance's blend of humanism and Christianity. His Greek edition of the New Testament (1516) — correcting errors in the Latin Vulgate — helped fuel the Reformation. His witty *In Praise of Folly* satirized clerical corruption.

### Copernicus and the Scientific Revolution

Nicholas Copernicus (1473–1543) placed the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the solar system — a revolution that launched modern astronomy and challenged the authority of medieval cosmology. His *De revolutionibus* was published the year he died (1543), carefully avoiding direct confrontation with the Church.

## The Renaissance and LDS Thought

From a Latter-day Saint perspective, the Renaissance has profound significance:

- The recovery of ancient texts helped prepare people to ask whether the ancient Church had something that the medieval Church had lost
- The printing press was providential in spreading the Bible, enabling the Reformation, and preparing the ground for religious pluralism in which the Restoration could occur
- The emphasis on human potential and learning resonates with LDS doctrine that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&C 93:36)
- Renaissance art, especially paintings of the life of Christ, has enriched Christian understanding of the Savior
