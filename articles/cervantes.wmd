:::summary
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616) was the greatest writer in the Spanish language and the author of *Don Quixote* (1605/1615) — widely considered the first modern novel and one of the greatest works of literature ever written. The story of a deluded Spanish gentleman who reads too many chivalric romances and sets out as a knight-errant, accompanied by his earthy squire Sancho Panza, is simultaneously a brilliant parody of medieval romance, a profound philosophical meditation on reality and illusion, a moving portrait of friendship and idealism, and an inexhaustible comedy. Cervantes's life was marked by extraordinary hardship — slavery, imprisonment, poverty — yet he produced a work of such richness and humor that it has never been surpassed.

## Life and Adventures

Cervantes's life reads like a picaresque novel — full of adventure, hardship, and ironic reversals. Born in 1547 in Alcalá de Henares, he received a modest education and spent years in Italy in the service of a cardinal. He fought at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 — the great naval battle in which the Holy League defeated the Ottoman fleet — where he received gunshot wounds that permanently crippled his left hand. He was proud of this injury for the rest of his life; he called himself "el manco de Lepanto" (the one-handed man of Lepanto).

Returning to Spain in 1575, his ship was captured by Barbary pirates and he was taken to Algiers as a slave. He spent five years in captivity, made four escape attempts (all foiled), and was finally ransomed by Trinitarian friars in 1580. Back in Spain, he worked as a government tax collector and procurement agent for the Armada — a job that brought him into constant financial difficulty and twice landed him in prison. It was reportedly in prison that he first conceived *Don Quixote*.

## Don Quixote

*Don Quixote* is so vast and rich that any summary risks falsifying it. Its premise: an aging Spanish gentleman named Alonso Quijano, having read so many chivalric romances that he has lost his mind, renames himself "Don Quixote de la Mancha," dons a rusted old suit of armor, and sets out to revive knight-errantry. He recruits a local farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire.

:::dropdown Part I (1605) — Adventures in a Disenchanted World
Don Quixote's adventures in Part I are largely comedic: he attacks windmills believing them to be giants; he liberates a chain gang of criminals (who immediately attack him); he falls in love with a peasant girl he calls "Dulcinea del Toboso" and imagines her as an enchanted princess; he involves himself in everyone's business in the conviction that chivalric duty demands it.

The comedy is not cruel — Cervantes never entirely mocks his hero. Quixote is deluded, but his delusion is driven by genuine idealism: a belief that the world should be better, that beauty and nobility should exist, that chivalric virtues are real. Sancho, his earthy, practical, sometimes skeptical squire, becomes one of literature's great comic characters in his own right — and their friendship, across the gulf of their different natures, is the heart of the book.

:::dropdown Part II (1615) — Deeper Waters
Part II, published ten years later and generally considered superior to Part I, is darker and more philosophical. Quixote and Sancho have become famous — people have read about their adventures in Part I — and the Duke and Duchess they encounter stage elaborate theatrical deceptions to entertain themselves at the heroes' expense. The cruelty of the deceptions raises uncomfortable questions about who the real fool is.

Most importantly, Part II explores what happens when Don Quixote begins to doubt. Towards the end, stripped of his illusions and lying on his deathbed, he recovers his sanity, renounces his chivalric fantasies, and dies as plain Alonso Quijano. The ending is devastating — his death is sadder than his madness. Sancho, who has learned to believe in his master's vision, begs him not to die: "Don't die, your grace... Maybe behind some bush we'll find the Lady Dulcinea disenchanted." It is one of the great endings in world literature.

## The Novel Form

Cervantes did not simply write a funny parody of chivalric romance — he invented the modern novel. *Don Quixote* is the first major work of prose fiction to:

- Present characters with psychological depth and development over time
- Explore the unreliability of perception and the instability of "reality"
- Use multiple nested narrators and frame stories self-consciously
- Have characters discuss and react to their own literary existence (in Part II, characters have read Part I)
- Combine comedy and tragedy, high and low styles, without resolving the tension between them

Almost every major novelist since — Fielding, Sterne, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Borges — has acknowledged Cervantes as the founder of the tradition.

## Themes

The deepest themes of *Don Quixote* include:

- **Illusion and reality**: What is the difference between a noble delusion and a true vision? Is Quixote's madness worse than the "sane" world's cynicism?
- **The power of stories**: Reading too many romances destroyed Quixote's grip on reality — but Cervantes's own book is also a story, also capable of reshaping how readers see the world. The novel is deeply self-aware about its own seductive power.
- **Friendship**: The relationship between Quixote and Sancho — a learned, idealistic madman and an illiterate, practical farmer — is a model of how different natures can complement and transform each other.
- **Faith and idealism**: Don Quixote's quixotic idealism (the word "quixotic" comes from his name) is at once ridiculous and noble. His refusal to accept the world as merely material, his insistence that there must be enchanted princesses and genuine nobility, resonates with Christian longing for a world transfigured by grace.

## Legacy

- *Don Quixote* has been translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible
- The word "quixotic" — meaning impractically idealistic — entered the English language from his name
- Dostoevsky called him "the most profound mystery of all" and the supreme statement of human idealism
- Jorge Luis Borges considered Cervantes the origin of all modern fiction
- He and [Shakespeare](article.html?id=shakespeare) died on the same date — April 23, 1616 (by different calendars)
