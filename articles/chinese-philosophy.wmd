:::summary
Chinese philosophy is one of the oldest and most distinctive intellectual traditions in the world, flourishing for more than two and a half millennia across a civilization of extraordinary continuity and sophistication. The great schools of ancient China — Confucianism, Taoism, Legalism, and Mohism — arose during the turbulent "Hundred Schools of Thought" period (6th–3rd centuries BC), producing foundational texts that shaped East Asian civilization as profoundly as Plato and Aristotle shaped the West. Later, Buddhism flowed in from India and was reshaped by Chinese genius into distinctive schools — Chan (Zen), Pure Land, and Hua-yen — that are among the richest developments in world philosophy and religion.

## Historical Context: The Warring States Period

Chinese philosophy arose in a time of crisis. The Zhou dynasty was fragmenting; rival states warred for supremacy; old social hierarchies were dissolving. Thinkers of every stripe competed to offer solutions to the crisis of political order and social harmony. This competition of ideas — the **Hundred Schools of Thought** (*Bǎijiā zhēngmíng*, literally "a hundred schools contend") — was China's most creative philosophical era, comparable to 5th-century Athens in its intellectual richness.

## Confucianism: The Way of Humaneness

**Kongzi** (Confucius, ~551–479 BC) is the most influential thinker in Chinese history and one of the most consequential in world history. His teachings — recorded by his disciples in the ***Analects*** — do not form a systematic philosophical treatise but a collection of conversations, sayings, and moral examples that define a way of life centered on virtue, right relationship, and social harmony.

### Core Confucian Concepts

**Rén (仁) — Humaneness or Benevolence**: The central virtue of Confucianism. *Rén* is the quality of genuine care for other persons — empathy, compassion, and love expressed in action. Confucius defined it in characteristically practical terms: "Do not impose on others what you do not want for yourself" — a formulation of the Golden Rule identical in substance to the teaching of Christ (Matthew 7:12).

**Lǐ (禮) — Ritual Propriety**: The network of correct behaviors, ceremonies, and social forms that maintain harmony in human relationships. *Lǐ* is not mere etiquette but the outward expression of inner virtue in social life.

**Yì (義) — Righteousness**: Acting according to what is genuinely right, not merely what is expedient or profitable.

**Zhèngmíng (正名) — The Rectification of Names**: Confucius taught that social disorder begins when names no longer correspond to realities — when rulers do not rule as rulers should, when fathers do not act as fathers should. "Let the ruler be a ruler, the minister a minister, the father a father, the son a son."

### Mencius and the Goodness of Human Nature

**Mencius** (Mengzi, ~372–289 BC) is the most important interpreter of Confucius and considered second in authority only to the Master himself. He argued that human nature is fundamentally **good**: every person has innate moral sprouts — compassion, shame, modesty, and moral discernment — that can be cultivated into virtue or neglected and corrupted by a bad environment.

Mencius also developed a remarkably progressive political philosophy: the *mandate of heaven* (*tiānmìng*) could be withdrawn from a tyrant; a ruler who failed his people had lost legitimacy and could be overthrown.

### Neo-Confucianism

In the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), **Zhu Xi** (1130–1200) synthesized Confucian ethics with Buddhist and Taoist metaphysics, creating **Neo-Confucianism** — the dominant philosophy of East Asian educated elites until the modern era. Zhu Xi emphasized *lǐ* (principle/pattern, a different character from "ritual") as the metaphysical structure ordering all things, and *qì* (vital energy/matter) as their physical substrate.

## Taoism: The Way of Nature

**Laozi** (Lao Tzu, traditionally 6th century BC) is credited with the ***Tao Te Ching*** ("The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue") — one of the most translated books in history, a mysterious and poetic text of 81 short chapters that resists systematic interpretation.

### The Tao

The ***Tao*** (道, "Way") is the ultimate principle underlying and pervading all reality. It is not a personal God but an impersonal ground of being — unnameable, uncreatable, inexhaustible:

:::quote Laozi, *Tao Te Ching*, Chapter 1
"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name."
:::

The sage lives in harmony with the Tao through ***wu wei*** (無為) — "non-action" or effortless action: acting in accordance with the natural flow of things rather than forcing or straining. Water is the Tao's great symbol: gentle, yielding, seeking the lowest place, yet wearing away the hardest stone.

### Zhuangzi

**Zhuangzi** (Zhuang Zhou, ~369–286 BC) is the other founding figure of Taoism and one of the great literary philosophers of any civilization. His text, the ***Zhuangzi***, is full of playful paradoxes, magnificent fables, and radical perspectivism. His most famous passage describes dreaming he was a butterfly, then waking as a man — uncertain whether he is a man dreaming of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man.

## Legalism: The Philosophy of Power

**Han Feizi** (~280–233 BC) was the chief theorist of **Legalism** — the coldly realistic school that rejected Confucian virtue in favor of strict law, clear rewards and punishments, and the absolute power of the ruler. Legalism became the dominant ideology of the Qin dynasty, which unified China in 221 BC but collapsed within fifteen years under its own harshness.

Legalism is philosophically significant as an early articulation of the view that political order depends not on the virtue of rulers but on institutional structures and incentives — a view that anticipates modern political science.

## Mohism: Universal Love

**Mozi** (Mo Di, ~470–391 BC) founded a rigorous and ascetic school that challenged Confucianism on several fronts. Most remarkably, Mozi taught **jiān ài** (兼愛) — "universal love" or "impartial concern": we should care for all people equally, not just our own family and social circle. He also rejected the elaborate and expensive rituals Confucians prized, argued for meritocracy over hereditary aristocracy, and developed an early version of consequentialist ethics.

Mohism faded after the Han dynasty but has attracted renewed scholarly attention for its anticipation of utilitarian ethics and its sophisticated early logic.

## Buddhism in China

Buddhism entered China from India along the Silk Road in the 1st century AD and underwent a profound transformation as it was absorbed and re-expressed by Chinese culture. Chinese Buddhist schools include:

- **Chan Buddhism** (Zen in Japan) — emphasizes direct meditation experience over doctrinal learning; the koan (paradoxical riddle) as a tool for breakthrough
- **Pure Land Buddhism** — devotional practice centered on faith in Amitabha Buddha and rebirth in the "Pure Land"
- **Hua-yen** — a grand metaphysical vision of the interpenetration of all phenomena, expressed in the image of Indra's net
