:::summary
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was the Italian physicist, mathematician, and astronomer who transformed humanity's understanding of motion, mechanics, and the cosmos. He improved the telescope and turned it on the night sky, discovered the moons of Jupiter, confirmed the heliocentric theory, and pioneered the experimental method that underlies all modern science. His famous conflict with the Church has been widely misunderstood and caricatured; the truth is far more nuanced and instructive.

## Early Life and Education

Galileo was born in Pisa in 1564, the same year Shakespeare was born and Michelangelo died. His father Vincenzo Galilei was a musician and musical theorist, a man who distrusted received authority and believed in testing claims by experiment — an intellectual heritage his son would take to extraordinary lengths.

Galileo enrolled at the University of Pisa to study medicine, but his passion was mathematics. He left without a degree, studied mathematics privately, and by the age of 25 was appointed professor of mathematics at Pisa. He moved to the University of Padua in 1592, where he would spend the most productive eighteen years of his scientific life.

## Physics and the Science of Motion

Before Galileo, the physics of motion was dominated by Aristotle's theories — the natural tendency of heavy objects to fall faster than light ones, the necessity of a continuous force to maintain motion, the incorruptibility of the heavens. Galileo challenged all of these, not through armchair reasoning but through careful observation and mathematical analysis.

:::dropdown The Law of Falling Bodies
Legend has it that Galileo dropped two balls of different mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and showed they hit the ground simultaneously. Whether or not this particular experiment took place exactly as described, Galileo did demonstrate through experiments with inclined planes that falling bodies accelerate uniformly regardless of their weight — directly contradicting Aristotle. This was a revolution in the understanding of gravity, later developed by Newton.

:::dropdown The Pendulum and Projectile Motion
Galileo discovered the law of the pendulum (that the period of a pendulum depends on its length, not its amplitude) — reportedly by timing the swings of a lamp in the Pisa cathedral with his own pulse. He also analyzed projectile motion, showing that it follows a parabolic trajectory — the combination of constant horizontal velocity and uniformly accelerating vertical fall.

## The Telescope and the Heavens

In 1609, Galileo heard reports of a Dutch instrument that made distant objects appear closer. He rapidly built his own improved version — a telescope magnifying approximately 20 times. What he then did was extraordinary: he turned it on the sky.

:::dropdown Discoveries of 1609–1610
In a few breathless months of observation, Galileo made discoveries that shattered the ancient Ptolemaic cosmology. He saw that:
- **The Moon** was not a perfect smooth sphere but had mountains, valleys, and craters — it was a world like the Earth.
- **Jupiter** had four moons orbiting it (now called the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) — proving that not everything in the sky revolved around the Earth.
- **Venus** exhibited phases, exactly like the Moon — which could only be explained if Venus orbited the *Sun*, not the Earth.
- **The Milky Way** was resolved into vast numbers of individual stars.
- **The Sun** had spots on its surface, and these sunspots moved — suggesting the Sun itself rotated.

Each discovery struck a blow at the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic worldview. Galileo published these findings in *Sidereus Nuncius* (The Starry Messenger, 1610), which made him famous across Europe.

## The Copernican Question

The heliocentric theory — that the Earth moves around the Sun rather than vice versa — had been proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543. Most astronomers recognized its mathematical elegance but were not convinced it described physical reality. Galileo became convinced it did.

His advocacy created the conflict for which he is most famous. In 1616, the Church formally declared heliocentrism contrary to Scripture and warned Galileo not to hold or defend the theory. He complied — for sixteen years. In 1632, emboldened by a new and initially friendly Pope (Urban VIII, formerly his friend and patron), Galileo published his *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*, a devastating satirical comparison of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems.

The Dialogue was widely read as championing heliocentrism — and as putting the Pope's own arguments in the mouth of a character named Simplicio (the simpleton). Urban VIII, furious and possibly feeling personally mocked, turned against Galileo.

:::dropdown The Trial of 1633 — A More Nuanced View
Galileo was summoned before the Roman Inquisition in 1633, found "vehemently suspect of heresy," and condemned to house arrest (not torture or prison), where he spent the last nine years of his life at his villa in Arcetri near Florence — comfortable enough that he continued to write his most important work on physics, *Two New Sciences* (1638).

The popular image of Galileo as a lone champion of science martyred by a monolithic anti-science Church is a nineteenth-century myth. The reality is more complex. Many churchmen supported his early work and accepted heliocentrism as a mathematical model. The conflict was partly theological, partly political, partly personal. Galileo's own evidence for heliocentrism was not conclusive by the standards of his day — he famously got the tides wrong. The definitive proof of Earth's motion (stellar parallax) would not come until 1838.

Pope John Paul II, in 1992, formally acknowledged that the Church had erred in its treatment of Galileo.

## The Father of Modern Science

Whatever the complexities of the Galileo affair, his scientific legacy is unambiguous. He is rightly called the father of modern physics and of the experimental scientific method. Where medieval natural philosophy had deduced conclusions from first principles and authority, Galileo measured, experimented, quantified, and let nature answer back.

His mathematical description of physical law — the insight that the "Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics" — became the founding principle of modern science. Isaac Newton built directly on Galileo's work on motion and falling bodies. Without Galileo, there is no Newton; without Newton, there is no modern physics.

Galileo died on January 8, 1642 — the year Newton was born.

## Faith and Science

Galileo himself was a believing Christian who saw no fundamental conflict between science and faith, but only between good science and bad interpretation of Scripture. In his famous letter to the Grand Duchess Christina (1615), he argued — drawing on Augustine — that the Bible teaches us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go. He believed that God had written two books: Scripture and Nature, and that both, rightly read, told the truth.
