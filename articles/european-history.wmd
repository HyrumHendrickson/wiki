:::summary
European history is the story of Western civilization — the extraordinary tradition born in ancient Greece and Rome, transformed by Christianity, refined through medieval Christendom, exploded by the Renaissance and Reformation, tested by the Enlightenment and the wars of ideology, and carrying into the present an inheritance of philosophy, law, science, art, and faith without parallel in human history. To understand Europe is to understand the roots of the world we inhabit.

## Ancient Greece: The Cradle of Western Thought

Greek civilization — centered on the city-states (*poleis*) of Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and others — produced between roughly 800 and 300 BC a flowering of intellectual and artistic achievement unparalleled in the ancient world. Greek philosophy gave the West its frameworks for thinking about reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), ethics, politics, and beauty (aesthetics). The great philosophers — [Socrates](article.html?id=socrates), [Plato](article.html?id=plato), and [Aristotle](article.html?id=aristotle) — established methods of rational inquiry that remain foundational to every intellectual discipline.

Greek democracy — born in Athens under Cleisthenes (508 BC) and refined under Pericles — introduced the radical idea that citizens should govern themselves. It was limited by modern standards (excluding women and enslaved people), but the principle it established — that government derives legitimacy from the consent of the governed — would echo through Roman republicanism, medieval Conciliarism, the English Parliament, and ultimately the American founding.

Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, Sophocles' tragedies, Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War, and Euclid's geometry are among the foundational texts of Western civilization — works studied and revered by educated Europeans for two and a half millennia.

## Rome: Law, Empire, and the Gospel

The Roman Republic (509–27 BC) and Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) translated Greek culture into a political and legal framework for the entire Mediterranean world. Rome's greatest contributions include:

- **Roman law** — the foundation of the legal systems of most European countries and, through them, much of the world
- **Engineering** — roads, aqueducts, arches, and concrete that shaped European civilization for centuries
- **The *Pax Romana*** (27 BC–180 AD) — two centuries of relative peace across a vast empire, providing the conditions in which Christianity spread with extraordinary speed

The Roman Empire is the world into which Jesus Christ was born, in which his apostles traveled and planted churches, and in which the New Testament was written. The *Pax Romana*, the Roman road system, the *koine* Greek common language, and the Roman postal system together created the infrastructure for the gospel's rapid spread. As Paul wrote to the Romans, "when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son" (Galatians 4:4) — into the very political and cultural moment that made the spread of that message possible.

The Edict of Milan (313 AD) granted Christianity legal toleration; the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), convened by Emperor Constantine, established the orthodox definition of Christ's divinity. By the end of the fourth century, Christianity had become the official religion of the Roman Empire.

:::dropdown The Fall of Rome and the Rise of Christendom
The fall of the Western Roman Empire (traditionally dated to 476 AD, when the last Western emperor was deposed) ushered in the period misleadingly called the "Dark Ages." It was a time of political fragmentation and violence, but also of extraordinary Christian cultural creativity: the monasteries that spread across Europe preserved classical learning, copied manuscripts, developed agriculture, established hospitals and schools, and maintained the intellectual and spiritual life of the continent.

The medieval period (roughly 500–1500 AD) was the era of Christendom — a civilization organized around the Catholic Church, with Christian faith as the shared framework of culture, law, scholarship, and politics. The great cathedrals of Gothic architecture, the universities born at Paris, Oxford, and Bologna, the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas synthesizing Aristotle with Christian theology, and the international republic of learning maintained by Latin scholarship are among its greatest achievements.

The Crusades (1095–1291) represent the most contested aspect of medieval Christendom — military campaigns to recover the Holy Land from Muslim rule that produced genuine heroism and genuine atrocity. They must be understood within the context of their time: an era of constant religious warfare in which Christian Europe felt existentially threatened, and in which the logic of holy war was shared by all parties.

## The Renaissance and Reformation

The **Renaissance** (roughly 1350–1600) began in the Italian city-states — Florence, Venice, Rome — and spread across Europe. It was a rebirth (*rinascita*) of classical Greek and Roman learning, art, and literature. Its achievements were stunning: Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio in literature; Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael in art; Galileo and Copernicus in science. The Renaissance produced the *studia humanitatis* — the classical curriculum of grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy — that has been the ideal of liberal education ever since.

The **Protestant Reformation** (beginning 1517) was sparked by Martin Luther's *Ninety-Five Theses* against indulgences. Luther's core theological claim — *sola fide* (by faith alone) — challenged the entire sacramental system of medieval Catholicism and triggered a century of religious wars, the fragmentation of Western Christendom, and ultimately the birth of political liberalism. John Calvin in Geneva, Thomas Cranmer in England, and John Knox in Scotland extended the Reformation into their national contexts. The Catholic Counter-Reformation, energized by the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and the Jesuit order, renewed Catholic life and scholarship and checked Protestant advance.

## The Enlightenment and Modern Europe

The **Enlightenment** (roughly 1650–1800) applied the methods of the Scientific Revolution to politics, religion, and society. Its ideals — reason, progress, individual rights, religious toleration — produced the American and French Revolutions. But the two revolutions took very different paths: the American Revolution was grounded in Christian natural law and produced ordered liberty; the French Revolution, more radical in its rejection of Christianity and tradition, produced the Terror and ultimately Napoleon.

The nineteenth century saw industrialization reshape European society, nationalism fracture the old empires, and ideologies — liberalism, socialism, nationalism, Marxism — compete to replace Christianity as the organizing principle of civilization. The catastrophe of this competition played out in the **First and Second World Wars** (1914–1918 and 1939–1945), the deadliest conflicts in human history, and in the totalitarian regimes — Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia — that stood as grim monuments to what happens when a civilization abandons the Christian foundation on which its values of human dignity were built.
