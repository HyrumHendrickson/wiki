        <strong>Summary</strong>
        Philosophy and theology are the great disciplines of human inquiry into truth, existence,
        and the nature of God. While philosophy asks questions about reality using reason alone,
        theology brings divine revelation into conversation with reason. From the perspective of
        Latter-day Saint thought, both are valuable tools — but revelation is the supreme source of
        truth, and the restored gospel provides answers that the greatest philosophers only glimpsed.

      <h2>What Is Philosophy?</h2>
      <p>
        Philosophy — from the Greek <em>philosophia</em>, meaning "love of wisdom" — is the
        disciplined study of fundamental questions: What exists? (Metaphysics) How do we know?
        (Epistemology) What is right? (Ethics) What is beauty? (Aesthetics) What is valid reasoning?
        (Logic)
      </p>
      <p>
        Philosophy originated in ancient Greece with thinkers like Thales, Socrates, Plato, and
        Aristotle, who sought to understand the world through reason rather than mythology alone.
        Their methods — careful analysis, logical argument, examination of assumptions — remain
        essential intellectual tools today.
      </p>

           Metaphysics — The Study of Reality
        </button>
        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Metaphysics asks: What is real? Does God exist? Do souls exist? What is the nature of
            time and space? Traditional (Platonic) metaphysics held that ultimate reality is abstract
            and immaterial — the "Forms" or "Ideas." Latter-day Saint theology, by contrast,
            teaches that God the Father has a glorified, tangible body of flesh and bones
            (D&amp;C 130:22), and that "all spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure"
            (D&amp;C 131:7). This is a radically different metaphysical claim from the mainstream
            Christian tradition influenced by Greek philosophy.

        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Epistemology asks: What is knowledge? How can we be certain of anything?
            Western philosophy has wrestled with skepticism — the worry that we might be wrong
            about everything — since Descartes. Latter-day Saint thought provides a distinctive
            answer: knowledge comes not just from reason and the senses, but through the
            <strong>Holy Ghost</strong>, who can witness truth to the spirit directly. This is
            not anti-rational; it is a broader view of what counts as evidence.

        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            Ethics asks: What is good? What do we owe each other? The great ethical traditions —
            Aristotle's virtue ethics, Kant's deontology, Mill's utilitarianism — each capture
            important truths. Latter-day Saint ethics is grounded in <strong>divine command</strong>
            (God's revealed will) combined with <strong>virtue</strong> (developing a Christlike
            character). The goal is not merely to follow rules but to become like God.

      <h2>What Is Theology?</h2>
      <p>
        Theology is "faith seeking understanding" (<em>fides quaerens intellectum</em>, as
        Anselm of Canterbury defined it). Theology uses reason to explore and articulate
        what has been revealed by God. It differs from philosophy in that it begins with
        revelation (scripture, prophets, tradition) rather than with unaided reason alone.

      <h2>Latter-day Saint Theology: A Distinctive Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Latter-day Saint theology is not simply a branch of traditional Protestant or Catholic
        theology — it is a restoration of original, ancient Christianity that diverges significantly
        from creeds developed in the centuries after the Apostasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key distinctive doctrines include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Godhead:</strong> God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct, separate beings — not a single substance.</li>
        <li><strong>Eternal Progression:</strong> Human beings are literally spirit children of God with the potential to grow to become like Him (Lorenzo Snow couplet: "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become").</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-mortal Existence:</strong> All humans lived as spirits with God before this earth life.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuing Revelation:</strong> God speaks to living prophets today, just as He did in ancient times.</li>
        <li><strong>Degrees of Glory:</strong> The afterlife has multiple kingdoms; virtually all people will receive a degree of glory (D&amp;C 76).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Value of Philosophy for Latter-day Saints</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph Smith taught that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;C 93:36) and that Latter-day
        Saints should seek learning "out of the best books" (D&amp;C 88:118). Philosophical training
        sharpens the mind, helps identify logical fallacies, and equips Saints to engage
        thoughtfully with critics and seekers. C.S. Lewis's rational defense of Christianity — even
        though it falls short of the restored gospel's fullness — has been valuable to many Latter-day
        Saint thinkers.
