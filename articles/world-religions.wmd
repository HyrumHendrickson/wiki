:::summary
The study of world religions is among the most important and humanizing of intellectual pursuits — it asks us to take seriously how billions of human beings across history and cultures have understood the deepest questions of existence: Who are we? Where do we come from? How should we live? What happens after death? From a Christian perspective, the study of world religions is not merely academic but an act of charity toward our neighbors: to understand their faith is to understand them, and to understand them is the first step toward sharing the truth and love of the Gospel.

## Why Study World Religions?

Christianity is the largest religion in the world — the faith of over two billion people. But it exists in a world with many other religious traditions, some ancient, some sophisticated, all worthy of respectful and serious attention. A classically educated Christian engages other faiths not with ignorance or contempt but with the confidence of one who knows what he believes and the charity of one who genuinely loves his neighbor.

The great Catholic philosopher [Aquinas](article.html?id=aquinas) taught that all truth is God's truth — wherever it is found. Studying other religions may reveal genuine insights about human nature, morality, or the nature of God that enrich our own understanding, even where we disagree with the conclusions reached.

At the same time, Christian conviction holds that Jesus Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6) — that the fullness of divine revelation was given in Him, and that the Church He founded is the custodian of saving truth. The study of other religions confirms, rather than undermines, this conviction: the more clearly we see what other faiths offer and where they fall short, the more the unique claims of Christianity stand out.

## Abrahamic Religions

See the full article on [Abrahamic Religions](article.html?id=abrahamic-religions) for detailed treatment of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

**Judaism** is the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, tracing its origin to the covenant God made with Abraham (~2000 BC) and refined through Moses and the Sinai covenant (~1400 BC). The Hebrew Scriptures — the Torah, Prophets, and Writings — are the foundation of Jewish faith and practice, and are also honored by Christians as the Old Testament. Judaism's core convictions: one transcendent Creator-God, the election of Israel as God's covenant people, the authority of Torah, and the hope of redemption and resurrection.

**Christianity** began with Jesus of Nazareth, who was born, lived, died, and rose again in 1st-century Palestine. Christians believe that Jesus is the eternal Son of God who became flesh for our salvation — the fulfillment of all Old Testament prophecy and the definitive revelation of God's character and saving purpose. See [Christianity](article.html?id=christianity) and [Christian History](article.html?id=christian-history).

**Islam** was founded by Muhammad (570–632 AD) in Arabia. Muslims believe that Muhammad was God's final prophet (*rasūl*), that the Quran is the direct word of God, and that salvation comes through submission (*islām*) to God's will. Islam shares with Christianity and Judaism belief in one God, in angels, in prophets, and in a final judgment, but denies the Trinity and the divinity of Christ.

## Dharmic Religions: Hinduism and Buddhism

### Hinduism

**Hinduism** is the world's oldest living religious tradition — a vast family of related beliefs, practices, and philosophies rather than a single creed, bound together by acceptance of the authority of the Vedas and the concept of *dharma* (cosmic and moral order). It encompasses profound philosophical schools (Vedanta), devotional traditions (bhakti), ritualistic practice, and the caste system. Key concepts: *Brahman* (ultimate reality), *ātman* (the soul), *karma* (moral cause and effect), *moksha* (liberation), *dharma* (duty/right order).

From a Christian perspective, Hinduism contains genuine insights — its sense of the sacred, its recognition that the ultimate ground of reality transcends all human categories, its moral seriousness — alongside doctrines (polytheism, the denial of a personal Creator-God, pantheism, the caste system) that contradict biblical revelation.

### Buddhism

**Buddhism** begins with the historical experience of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha, c. 563–483 BC), who attained enlightenment and taught the **Four Noble Truths** and the **Eightfold Path** as the way to liberation from suffering. Buddhism is extraordinarily diverse — from the Theravada of Southeast Asia to the Mahayana schools of East Asia to Tibetan Vajrayana — but is united by the rejection of a permanent self (*anātman*), emphasis on the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena, and the goal of *nirvāna*.

Christianity and Buddhism share moral seriousness, compassion for the suffering, and a critique of greed and attachment. They differ fundamentally on the nature of the self, the existence of a personal God, and the ultimate goal of human existence.

## Taoism and Confucianism

These Chinese philosophical-religious traditions are treated in depth in [Chinese Philosophy](article.html?id=chinese-philosophy). Both are ancient, sophisticated, and deeply woven into East Asian civilization. **Confucianism** is primarily an ethical and social philosophy centered on virtue and right relationship; **Taoism** is a mystical and cosmic philosophy centered on attunement with the *Tao* (the Way underlying all things).

## Indigenous and Primal Religions

Every culture on earth has developed religious practices for relating to the divine, the natural world, and the community of the living and the dead. These traditions — often called "primal," "indigenous," or "tribal" religions — vary enormously but often share features: a sacred cosmos, rituals of passage, ancestor veneration, and a sense of the spiritual dimensions of the natural world. Missionaries have carried the Gospel to every corner of the world, often finding that primal religious intuitions — a sense of spiritual power, moral accountability, the reality of the sacred — prepared hearts to receive the Good News.

## The Phenomenology of Religion

Scholars of comparative religion attempt to describe and understand religious traditions as their adherents actually experience them, without presupposing the truth or falsity of any. Key figures include Rudolf Otto (*Das Heilige*, 1917 — the concept of the *numinous*, the overwhelming sense of the holy as "wholly other"), Mircea Eliade (*The Sacred and the Profane*, 1957 — the distinction between sacred and profane space and time), and Wilfred Cantwell Smith (*The Meaning and End of Religion*, 1962).
