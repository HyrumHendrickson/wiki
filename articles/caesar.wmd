## Early Life and Rise

Caesar was born into the patrician *gens Julia*, a family that traced its lineage to the goddess Venus — though his family was not wealthy in his youth. He showed early brilliance as a speaker and politician and quickly rose through Rome's political ranks.

In 60 BC, Caesar formed the First Triumvirate — an informal political alliance with the wealthy Crassus and the great general Pompey. This alliance gave Caesar the political backing to gain the consulship and then the governorship of Gaul.

## The Gallic Wars (58–50 BC)

Caesar's campaigns in Gaul (modern France, Belgium, and parts of Germany) transformed him from a promising politician into the greatest general of his age. In eight years, he:

- Conquered all of Gaul, adding vast wealth and territory to Rome
- Twice crossed into Britain (55 and 54 BC)
- Crossed the Rhine into Germany
- Wrote *Commentarii de Bello Gallico* — vivid, first-person accounts of the campaigns that remain masterpieces of Latin prose

The wars resulted in approximately one million Gauls killed and another million enslaved — among the most brutal episodes of ancient conquest.

## Crossing the Rubicon (49 BC)

When the Senate, pressured by Pompey, ordered Caesar to disband his army, Caesar faced a choice: comply and return as a private citizen (risking prosecution by his enemies), or march on Rome. On January 10, 49 BC, he led his army across the Rubicon River — the legal boundary beyond which a general could not bring his troops — saying, according to tradition, *"alea iacta est"* — "the die is cast."

The phrase "crossing the Rubicon" has since become a universal metaphor for passing the point of no return.

## Civil War and Dictatorship

Caesar's march on Rome triggered civil war. Pompey fled to Greece, where Caesar defeated him at the Battle of Pharsalus (48 BC). Pompey was assassinated in Egypt shortly afterward. Caesar then became involved with Cleopatra VII of Egypt and spent time reorganizing the eastern provinces before returning to Rome.

By 44 BC, Caesar had been appointed *Dictator perpetuo* — dictator in perpetuity — a title without republican precedent that alarmed many senators who feared the end of the Republic.

## The Ides of March (44 BC)

On March 15, 44 BC — the Ides of March — a group of senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus assassinated Caesar in the Theatre of Pompey. He was stabbed 23 times.

The assassination did not save the Republic. Caesar's adopted son Octavian (later Augustus) emerged from the subsequent civil wars as Rome's first Emperor, completing the transformation Caesar had set in motion.

## Caesar's Legacy

| Legacy | Description |
|---|---|
| The Julian Calendar | Caesar reformed the Roman calendar; his 365.25-day year was the basis for the Gregorian Calendar still used today |
| Imperial Title | "Caesar" became the title for all subsequent Roman emperors; it gave rise to "Kaiser" (German) and "Tsar" (Russian) |
| Latin Prose | His *Commentarii* remain required reading for Latin students; a model of clarity and force |
| The Roman Empire | His career ended the Republic and prepared the Empire into which Christ was born |

## Caesar and Sacred History

From a Latter-day Saint perspective, Caesar's career is significant because it set in motion the political transformation that produced the *Pax Romana* — the Roman Peace under Augustus — during which Jesus Christ was born (Luke 2:1 records that Jesus was born during a census decreed by "Caesar Augustus"). The Roman world Caesar helped create became the providential setting for the Savior's mortal ministry.
