        <strong>Summary</strong>
        The Book of Mormon is a sacred volume of scripture and a keystone of Latter-day Saint faith.
        Its full title — <em>The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</em> — declares its
        central purpose: to testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. Translated by
        Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God from ancient golden plates, it records the
        history, prophecies, and teachings of peoples who inhabited the ancient Americas.

      <h2>What Is the Book of Mormon?</h2>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon is one of four volumes of scripture used by members of The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-day Saints — alongside the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl
        of Great Price. President Ezra Taft Benson called it the <strong>"keystone of our religion,"</strong>
        teaching that just as a keystone holds an arch together, the Book of Mormon holds the Restoration
        together: if it is true, then Joseph Smith was a prophet, and the Church is true. [1]
      </p>

      <h2>Origins and Translation</h2>
      <p>
        In September 1823, the angel <strong>Moroni</strong> appeared to the young Joseph Smith and
        told him of a record buried in a nearby hillside. This record — engraved on golden plates —
        contained the history of ancient peoples in the Americas who had received the gospel of
        Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joseph received the plates in 1827 and, with the help of scribes (primarily Oliver Cowdery),
        translated the record through the <em>Urim and Thummim</em> and a seer stone — instruments
        prepared by God for this purpose. The translation was completed in approximately 65 working
        days in 1829, a remarkable feat given the length and complexity of the text. [2]
      </p>

          <p>
            Eleven men besides Joseph Smith served as witnesses of the Book of Mormon plates.
            <strong>Three Witnesses</strong> — Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris —
            were shown the plates by the angel Moroni and heard the voice of God declaring
            the translation correct. <strong>Eight Witnesses</strong> physically handled and
            examined the plates under daylight. None of these witnesses ever denied their testimony.

      <h2>Structure and Contents</h2>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon contains 15 books (smaller volumes), spanning roughly 1,000 years of
        history from about 600 BC to AD 421. The primary narrative follows two civilizations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Nephites</strong> — descendants of the prophet Lehi and his family, who
          left Jerusalem around 600 BC and sailed to the Americas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Lamanites</strong> — a branch of Lehi's family that separated from the Nephites.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The book also contains a shorter account of the <strong>Jaredites</strong>, a civilization
        that came to the Americas at the time of the Tower of Babel.

      <h2>The Central Message: Jesus Christ</h2>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon's driving purpose is to testify of Jesus Christ. Every prophet within
        its pages — from Lehi to Mormon to Moroni — bears witness of the Savior. The Book of Mormon
        contains some of the most powerful, detailed descriptions of the Atonement of Jesus Christ
        found in any scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrected Jesus Christ personally visited the people of the ancient Americas after His
        resurrection (3 Nephi 11), showing His hands and feet and inviting each person to come
        forward and feel the wounds in His hands and feet and side. He then established His Church
        among them with the same organization He had in Jerusalem.
      </p>

      <h2>Moroni's Promise</h2>
      <p>
        The final chapter of the Book of Mormon contains one of the most important promises in all
        of scripture. Moroni invites every reader to:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid var(--color-primary); margin:1rem 0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; font-style:italic;">
        "…ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if
        ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest
        the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."
        <footer>— Moroni 10:4</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This promise — that God will answer a sincere prayer — is the foundation of Latter-day Saint
        testimony. Millions of people worldwide have received a witness of the Book of Mormon's truth
        through the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
