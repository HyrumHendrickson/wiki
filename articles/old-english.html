        <strong>Summary</strong>
        Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon) is the earliest form of the English language, spoken
        in England from roughly AD 450 to 1150. It is the language of the epic poem
        <em>Beowulf</em>, the first Christian literary works in England, and the direct ancestor of
        every English word we use today. J.R.R. Tolkien, a professor of Old English at Oxford,
        drew heavily on the language and literature of the Anglo-Saxons in creating Middle-earth.

      <h2>Origins of Old English</h2>
      <p>
        Old English developed from the Germanic dialects brought to Britain by the <strong>Angles,
        Saxons, and Jutes</strong> — peoples from what is now northern Germany and Denmark — who
        began settling Britain in the 5th century AD after the Roman legions withdrew. Over time,
        their dialects merged into a common language that would become English.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language was strongly shaped by <strong>Christianity</strong>. When Augustine of Canterbury
        brought Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England in AD 597, Latin learning flourished. Monks
        translated scriptures and wrote history in Old English, creating a rich literary tradition.
      </p>

      <h2>The Sound and Look of Old English</h2>
      <p>
        Old English looks quite different from modern English — reading it requires real study,
        much like learning a foreign language. However, many core English words are recognizable:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Old English</th><th>Modern English</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>mann</td><td>man</td></tr>
          <tr><td>wīf</td><td>wife</td></tr>
          <tr><td>gōd</td><td>good</td></tr>
          <tr><td>heofon</td><td>heaven</td></tr>
          <tr><td>God</td><td>God</td></tr>
          <tr><td>lufu</td><td>love</td></tr>
          <tr><td>eorþe</td><td>earth</td></tr>
          <tr><td>cyning</td><td>king</td></tr>
          <tr><td>sōþ</td><td>sooth (truth)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Old English has several letters not found in modern English:
        <strong>þ</strong> (thorn, pronounced "th"), <strong>ð</strong> (eth, also "th"),
        and <strong>æ</strong> (ash, a vowel sound between "a" and "e").
      </p>

      <h2>Beowulf</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Beowulf</em> is the greatest surviving work of Old English literature — a 3,182-line
        epic poem describing the hero Beowulf's battles against the monster Grendel, Grendel's
        mother, and a dragon. It is among the oldest poems in any Germanic language.
      </p>
      <p>
        The poem has a distinctly Christian overlay on older pagan material — the monsters are
        described as descendants of the biblical Cain, and God's providence is acknowledged
        throughout. This blending of Christian faith and heroic tradition is characteristic of
        Anglo-Saxon culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark 1936 essay, <em>"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics,"</em>
        rescued <em>Beowulf</em> from being treated merely as a historical document and established
        it as a great work of literature deserving to be read on its own terms. Tolkien later
        produced his own translation of the poem.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Old English and Christianity</h2>
      <p>
        The Anglo-Saxon church produced remarkable Christian literature. <strong>Bede</strong>
        (c. 673–735), the "Father of English History," wrote the <em>Ecclesiastical History of the
        English People</em>. <strong>King Alfred the Great</strong> (849–899) translated portions
        of the Bible and other Christian works into Old English to make them accessible to his
        people, in a manner reminiscent of Joseph Smith's mission to make the word of God plain
        and accessible to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Lindisfarne Gospels</strong> (c. AD 715–720) — a beautifully illuminated Latin
        Gospel book — were later given an Old English interlinear translation, one of the earliest
        vernacular Gospel translations in history.
      </p>

      <h2>Old English's Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        After the Norman Conquest of 1066, Old English was gradually replaced by Middle English —
        a hybrid of Old English and the Norman French of the conquerors. Yet the core vocabulary
        of English (articles, pronouns, basic verbs, numbers, body parts) remains overwhelmingly
        Old English in origin. Every English speaker, whether they know it or not, speaks a
        language built on an Anglo-Saxon foundation.
