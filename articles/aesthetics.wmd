:::summary
Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy concerned with beauty, art, and taste — asking what makes something beautiful, what art is and why it matters, and whether aesthetic judgments are objective or merely subjective. From Plato's suspicion of poetry to Kant's analysis of the sublime, aesthetics has grappled with the deepest questions about human experience and the value of the beautiful.

## What Is Aesthetics?

Aesthetics — from the Greek *aisthetikos*, relating to perception — is the philosophical study of sensory and emotional responses to beauty, art, and the natural world. Although the term was first used in its modern philosophical sense by Alexander Baumgarten in 1750, the questions it addresses are as old as philosophy itself.

The central questions of aesthetics include:

- **What is beauty?** Is it an objective property of things, a subjective response of perceivers, or something in between?
- **What is art?** What distinguishes a work of art from an ordinary object? Must art be beautiful, expressive, or intentional?
- **What is the value of art?** Why should we care about art? Does it educate, purify, entertain, or reveal truth?
- **Are aesthetic judgments subjective?** When two people disagree about whether a painting is beautiful, is one of them wrong?

## Classical Aesthetics

:::dropdown Plato and the Danger of Art
Plato held a complex and somewhat suspicious view of art. In the *Republic*, he argued that art (especially poetry and drama) should be censored or restricted in the ideal state, for several reasons:

1. **Mimesis (imitation)**: Art imitates the physical world, which is itself only an imperfect copy of the eternal Forms. A painting of a bed is twice removed from the Form of Bed — a copy of a copy.
2. **Emotional corruption**: Art appeals to the irrational, emotional parts of the soul rather than reason, potentially making emotions stronger and harder to control.
3. **Moral influence**: If art depicts immoral behavior sympathetically, it may encourage immoral attitudes in the audience.

Despite this critique, Plato himself was a literary artist of great power — the *Symposium* contains one of the most beautiful philosophical discussions of love and beauty ever written, including the famous "Ladder of Beauty" in which Diotima describes ascending from love of a beautiful body to love of beauty itself.

:::dropdown Aristotle and Catharsis
Aristotle's *Poetics* offers a sustained defense of art, particularly tragedy, against Plato's critique. For Aristotle, tragedy is not a danger to the soul — it is a source of **catharsis**: the purging or purification of the emotions of pity and fear.

By witnessing fictional suffering, the audience exercises and refines its emotional responses in a safe context. Great tragedy — like Sophocles' *Oedipus Rex* — produces *recognition* (*anagnorisis*) and *reversal* (*peripeteia*), leading the audience to insights about human life that they could not easily obtain otherwise.

Aristotle also argued that art reveals the universal — what *would* happen given human nature and circumstance — rather than merely the particular. In this sense, poetry is "more philosophical" than history: it shows not just what *did* happen but what *tends* to happen.

:::dropdown Hume and the Standard of Taste
David Hume's essay "Of the Standard of Taste" (1757) addresses the apparent paradox of aesthetic disagreement: on the one hand, we feel that taste is merely personal and subjective; on the other, we feel that saying Beethoven is a greater composer than a children's rhyme is more than just expressing a preference.

Hume's solution: while there is no objective property "beauty" in objects, there are better and worse *perceivers*. The ideal judge of taste has: (1) delicate sensory discrimination; (2) extensive practice with the art form; (3) broad comparative experience; (4) freedom from prejudice; and (5) good sense. When such ideal judges agree, their verdicts constitute something close to an objective standard of taste.

This elegant solution influenced Kant and remains important in contemporary aesthetics and art criticism.

:::dropdown Kant and the Sublime
Immanuel Kant's *Critique of Judgment* (1790) is the most sophisticated analysis of aesthetic experience in the philosophical tradition. Kant distinguishes several types of judgment:

- **The agreeable**: "This wine is pleasant" — purely subjective, based on personal sensation.
- **The good**: "Honesty is good" — objective, based on reason and moral principle.
- **The beautiful**: "This sunset is beautiful" — claims universal assent, yet is based on feeling rather than concepts.

For Kant, judgments of beauty are distinctive: they feel universal (we expect others to agree, unlike with merely agreeable things) but cannot be proved by argument (unlike moral judgments). Beauty is defined as what pleases through the **free play of the imagination and understanding** — a disinterested pleasure that is not based on desire or utility.

Kant also introduces the concept of the **sublime** — the experience of awe in the face of something vast, powerful, or overwhelming. Unlike beauty (which involves harmony and form), the sublime involves an initial feeling of being overwhelmed, followed by a triumphant realization of the dignity and power of human reason, which can comprehend even that which exceeds the senses.

## Art, Expression, and Truth

Later aestheticians raised new questions about the nature and value of art:

- **Expression theories** (Tolstoy, Croce): Art is the expression of emotion. A genuine work of art communicates the artist's inner feeling to the audience.
- **Formalism** (Bell, Fry): The value of art lies in its formal qualities — shape, color, composition — not in what it represents or expresses.
- **Institutional theory** (Dickie): A work of art is anything the "artworld" (artists, critics, curators) recognizes as art. This accounts for avant-garde works like Duchamp's *Fountain* but seems to make "art" definitionally empty.
- **Representational/imitation theories**: Art is valuable because of what it depicts or represents — returning to a version of the classical view.

## Aesthetics and Faith

The relationship between beauty and the sacred is ancient and profound. Nearly every religious tradition has developed artistic forms — music, architecture, iconography, literature — to express and evoke religious experience. Theological aesthetics, developed by thinkers like Hans Urs von Balthasar, argues that beauty is a genuine *transcendental* — a property that points toward God, who is the source of all beauty.

Latter-day Saint culture places significant emphasis on artistic expression through music, theater, and visual arts. Temple architecture — designed to be beautiful, sacred, and distinct from ordinary buildings — reflects the conviction that beauty is not ornamental but spiritually significant.
