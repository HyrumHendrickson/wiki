        <strong>Summary</strong>
        Joseph Smith Jr. (1805–1844) was the founding prophet and first president of The Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Latter-day Saints believe he was called of God to restore
        the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth — including priesthood authority,
        saving ordinances, and new scripture — after centuries of apostasy.

      <h2>Early Life and the First Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph Smith was born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont, the fourth of eleven children
        of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. His family was deeply religious but lived in an era
        of intense religious revival and competition in upstate New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring of 1820, at about age fourteen, Joseph went to a grove of trees near his home
        to pray and ask God which church he should join. In response, God the Father and Jesus Christ
        appeared to him in a vision — what Latter-day Saints call the <strong>First Vision</strong>.
        Joseph was told that none of the existing churches had the fullness of the gospel and that he
        was to be an instrument in restoring it. [1]
      </p>
      <p>
        Joseph described the experience:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid var(--color-primary); margin:1rem 0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; font-style:italic;">
        "I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in
        the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other —
        <em>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</em>"
        <footer>— Joseph Smith—History 1:17</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Translation of the Book of Mormon</h2>
      <p>
        Beginning in 1823, the angel Moroni instructed Joseph over four years and ultimately delivered
        to him a set of golden plates buried in a hillside near Palmyra, New York. From 1828 to 1829,
        Joseph translated these plates into the Book of Mormon through divine inspiration, with Oliver
        Cowdery as his primary scribe. The translation was completed in roughly 65 working days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon was published in March 1830 and remains one of the most studied religious
        texts in the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Restoration of the Priesthood</h2>
      <p>
        In May 1829, John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon
        them the <strong>Aaronic Priesthood</strong>. Shortly after, Peter, James, and John —
        Apostles of Jesus Christ — appeared and conferred the <strong>Melchizedek Priesthood</strong>
        upon them. This restored the authority to act in God's name — authority that Latter-day Saints
        believe had been lost from the earth since the early Christian era.
      </p>

      <h2>Founding of the Church</h2>
      <p>
        On April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York, Joseph Smith formally organized The Church of Christ
        (later renamed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) with six founding members.
        Through the 1830s the Church grew rapidly and established communities in Ohio, Missouri,
        and Illinois.

      <h2>Martyrdom</h2>
      <p>
        Opposition to Joseph Smith and the Church was intense throughout his life. In June 1844,
        Joseph and his brother Hyrum were imprisoned in Carthage Jail, Illinois, on false charges.
        On June 27, 1844, a mob stormed the jail and shot Joseph and Hyrum. Joseph died at age 38.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latter-day Saints regard Joseph Smith as a martyr who <em>"sealed his testimony with his blood"</em>
        (Doctrine and Covenants 135:3). His successor, Brigham Young, led the Saints to the Salt Lake
        Valley in 1847.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph Smith's theological legacy is vast. His revelations expanded Christian understanding
        of the nature of God, the pre-mortal existence of mankind, the three degrees of glory in the
        afterlife, the eternal nature of families, and the ongoing nature of revelation. Today,
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has over 17 million members worldwide —
        all tracing their faith to the restoration begun through Joseph Smith.
