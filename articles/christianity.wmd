:::summary
Christianity is the world's largest religion — the faith of more than two billion people — and the spiritual, moral, and intellectual foundation of Western civilization. It is centered on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**: his birth in Bethlehem, his ministry in Galilee and Judea, his crucifixion and bodily resurrection in Jerusalem, and his promise to return. Christians believe that Jesus is the eternal Son of God who became human for our salvation — that in his death the debt of human sin was paid and in his resurrection the power of death was broken — and that all who trust in him receive forgiveness, new life, and the hope of eternal glory.

## The Person of Jesus Christ

Christianity stands or falls on the historical person of **Jesus of Nazareth**. He was born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary, raised in Nazareth, baptized by John in the Jordan River, and spent approximately three years proclaiming the **Kingdom of God** throughout Galilee and Judea. He healed the sick, fed the hungry, forgave sins, called twelve disciples, and made claims about himself that were unprecedented: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30); "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25); "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6).

He was crucified by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate under pressure from the Jewish religious establishment, died, was buried — and on the third day, according to the unanimous testimony of the earliest sources, **rose bodily from the dead**. He appeared to his disciples over forty days, commissioned them to make disciples of all nations, ascended into heaven, and poured out the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

## The Gospel: Good News

The word "gospel" (*euangelion* in Greek) means "good news." The good news that Christianity proclaims is this:

- **God is good** and created a good world — but humanity fell into sin (Genesis 3), separating us from God and introducing suffering, evil, and death.
- **God is just**: sin cannot simply be overlooked; it demands a reckoning.
- **God is merciful**: rather than leaving us in our sin, he sent his Son — fully God and fully man — to live the perfect life we could not live and to die the death we deserved.
- **Christ's resurrection** is the vindication of his sacrifice and the first fruits of the new creation: death is not the last word.
- **Salvation is by grace through faith** (Ephesians 2:8–9): it is God's free gift, received by trusting in Christ, not earned by human effort.
- **The Holy Spirit** dwells in believers, transforming them from within — enabling them to love God and neighbor and grow in holiness.

## The Bible

Christianity is a **biblical religion** — its faith, doctrine, and practice are rooted in and accountable to the witness of the **[Bible](article.html?id=bible)**. The Bible consists of:

- **The Old Testament** — the Hebrew Scriptures, which Christians read as the story of God's preparation for the coming of Christ: creation, fall, the call of Abraham, the Exodus, the Davidic monarchy, and the prophetic hope for a coming Messiah.
- **The New Testament** — 27 books written by the apostles and their associates in the 1st century AD: four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), the Acts of the Apostles, twenty-one letters, and the book of Revelation.

Christians believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God — "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16).

## Core Christian Doctrines

### The Trinity

Christianity's most distinctive and most challenging doctrine is the **Trinity**: there is one God who exists eternally as three distinct Persons — **Father**, **Son** (Jesus Christ), and **Holy Spirit**. Each Person is fully God; there are not three gods but one. This mystery was not invented by the councils but was already embedded in the New Testament and the practice of Christian worship from the beginning.

The Council of **Nicaea** (325 AD) declared the Son "of one substance with the Father" (*homoousios*) — decisively rejecting Arianism, which held the Son to be a created being less than the Father.

### The Incarnation

**Incarnation** means "enfleshment" — the eternal Son of God taking on human nature in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Jesus Christ is therefore **fully God and fully human** — two natures in one person (*hypostatic union*), as defined by the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD). This doctrine is not a philosopher's abstraction but the heart of the Gospel: God himself entered human history to save us from within.

### Atonement

The **atonement** is God's act of reconciling sinful humanity to himself through the sacrifice of Christ. The New Testament uses many images to describe it: a substitutionary sacrifice (Christ bearing our punishment), a ransom (buying us out of slavery to sin and death), a victory over the powers of evil, a demonstration of God's love. The key text is Isaiah 53: "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities... and with his stripes we are healed."

### Resurrection and Eternal Life

The bodily **resurrection** of Jesus is not a metaphor but a historical claim — Paul declares it the very foundation of Christian faith: "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Christians await the resurrection of their own bodies at the last day and eternal life in the presence of God.

## The Church

Jesus said "I will build my church" (Matthew 16:18) — he intended a **community** of believers, not merely a collection of isolated individuals. The Church is the Body of Christ, animated by the Holy Spirit, charged with proclaiming the Gospel, baptizing, teaching, and caring for the poor and vulnerable.

**Baptism** is the rite of initiation into the Christian community — dying and rising with Christ in symbol (Romans 6:3–4). **The Lord's Supper** (Eucharist/Communion) is the central act of Christian worship, in which bread and wine are shared in remembrance of Christ's body and blood.

Christianity has split into many branches: the **Roman Catholic Church**, the **Eastern Orthodox** churches, and the many **Protestant** denominations born from the Reformation. See [Christian History](article.html?id=christian-history) and [Reformation](article.html?id=reformation).

## Christianity and Western Civilization

Christianity is not merely a private religious conviction; it has been the foundational force shaping Western civilization. The university (Bologna, Oxford, Paris) was a Christian invention. The great cathedrals of Europe, the music of Bach and Handel, the paintings of Michelangelo and Raphael, the literature of Dante and Milton — all grew from Christian soil. The [American founding](article.html?id=declaration-of-independence) drew directly on Christian convictions about human dignity, natural law, and divine governance.

The conviction that every human being bears the *imago Dei* — the image of God — is the deepest root of the Western commitment to human dignity, equality under the law, and the protection of the innocent.
