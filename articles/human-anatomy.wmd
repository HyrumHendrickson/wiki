:::summary
Human anatomy is the science of the structure of the human body — the bones, muscles, organs, and tissues that together form one of the most complex and wondrous creations in the known universe. The Psalmist declared that we are "fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:14), and the study of anatomy confirms this testimony at every level: from the microscopic architecture of a single cell to the elegant engineering of the skeletal frame, the human body bears the unmistakable signature of a master Designer.

## What Is Human Anatomy?

Anatomy (from the Greek *ana-* "up" + *temnein* "to cut") is the study of the structure of living organisms. Human anatomy focuses specifically on the body's physical organization — how its parts are arranged, connected, and integrated. **Gross anatomy** studies structures visible to the naked eye; **histology** (or microscopic anatomy) examines tissues and cells; **neuroanatomy** focuses on the nervous system; **embryology** traces the development of structures from conception to birth.

The great milestone in anatomy's history was Andreas Vesalius's *De Humani Corporis Fabrica* (1543), which replaced centuries of errors inherited from Galen with direct, systematic observation of the human body. Vesalius's insistence on firsthand observation over received authority exemplifies the spirit of honest inquiry that Christians at their best have always championed.

## The Major Organ Systems

The human body is organized into **eleven major organ systems**, each performing a specific set of functions while integrating seamlessly with all the others:

| System | Primary Function |
|---|---|
| Skeletal | Support, protection, movement, blood cell production |
| Muscular | Movement, posture, heat generation |
| Nervous | Sensation, integration, and response |
| Endocrine | Hormonal regulation of growth, metabolism, reproduction |
| Cardiovascular | Circulation of blood, oxygen, and nutrients |
| Lymphatic/Immune | Fluid balance, immune defense |
| Respiratory | Gas exchange (oxygen in, carbon dioxide out) |
| Digestive | Breakdown and absorption of nutrients |
| Urinary | Waste excretion, fluid/electrolyte balance |
| Reproductive | Production of offspring |
| Integumentary | Protection, temperature regulation, sensation (skin) |

No system operates in isolation. The cardiovascular system delivers oxygen that the respiratory system captures; the endocrine system signals the reproductive system; the nervous system controls the muscular system. This integration is one of the most compelling arguments for purposeful design in nature.

:::dropdown The Skeletal System
The adult human skeleton comprises **206 bones** organized into two divisions:
- The **axial skeleton** (80 bones) — skull, vertebral column, rib cage — forms the central axis of the body.
- The **appendicular skeleton** (126 bones) — limbs and the pectoral and pelvic girdles — enables movement.

Bones are not inert scaffolding. They are living tissues that constantly remodel themselves in response to mechanical stress, store calcium and phosphorus, produce red and white blood cells in their **red bone marrow**, and house yellow bone marrow as a fat reserve.

Joints connect bones and enable movement. Synovial joints — the freely movable joints of limbs — are lined with cartilage and lubricated by synovial fluid, reducing friction with remarkable efficiency. The shoulder joint trades stability for mobility; the hip joint trades mobility for stability — each a design suited to its function.

:::dropdown The Cardiovascular System
The heart is a fist-sized muscle that beats approximately 100,000 times per day, pumping 5–6 liters of blood per minute throughout the body. It is divided into four chambers:
- **Right atrium and right ventricle** — receive deoxygenated blood from the body and pump it to the lungs
- **Left atrium and left ventricle** — receive oxygenated blood from the lungs and pump it to the body

William Harvey's 1628 discovery of the circulation of the blood — demonstrating that the heart pumps blood continuously around a closed circuit — was one of the greatest achievements in the history of medicine. It overturned more than a millennium of Galenic error and opened the era of modern physiology.

The circulatory system includes approximately 60,000 miles of blood vessels: arteries (carrying oxygenated blood away from the heart), veins (returning deoxygenated blood to the heart), and capillaries (the microscopic vessels where exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products actually occurs).

## The Nervous System

The nervous system is the body's master communication network. It is divided into:
- The **central nervous system (CNS)** — the brain and spinal cord
- The **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** — all nerves outside the CNS

The human brain contains approximately **86 billion neurons**, each capable of forming thousands of connections. The resulting network — with an estimated 100 trillion synapses — is the most complex structure known in the universe. It processes sensory information, coordinates movement, regulates bodily functions, and gives rise to thought, emotion, memory, language, creativity, and consciousness itself.

The brain is organized into regions with specialized functions: the **cerebral cortex** for higher cognitive functions, the **cerebellum** for coordination, the **brainstem** for vital autonomic functions (breathing, heart rate), the **limbic system** for emotion and memory, and the **hypothalamus** for hormonal and autonomic regulation.

## Anatomy and the Imago Dei

Christians understand the human body not merely as a biological machine but as the dwelling place of a person made in the *image of God* (*imago Dei*, Genesis 1:26–27) and — for believers — a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). The doctrine of the resurrection of the body (affirmed in the Nicene Creed and central to Latter-day Saint theology) gives additional theological weight to the physical human form: the body is not merely a temporary container but an essential part of personal identity intended for eternal glorification.

Paul's description of the Church as a "body" in which every member has a distinct and essential function (1 Corinthians 12) draws on anatomical understanding to make a spiritual point — suggesting that the integrated complexity of the human body is itself a model of divine wisdom.
