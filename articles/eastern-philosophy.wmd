:::summary
Eastern philosophy encompasses the rich and diverse philosophical traditions of Asia — the Hindu philosophies of India, the Buddhist traditions originating in India and flowering across Asia, the Confucian and Taoist schools of China, and the meditative and martial traditions of Japan and Korea. These traditions address the same fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, the self, and the good life as Western philosophy, but often from strikingly different starting points, using different methods, and reaching different conclusions. A classically educated mind benefits enormously from engaging Eastern philosophy — not to abandon the Western tradition but to see it more clearly by comparison.

## What Is Eastern Philosophy?

"Eastern philosophy" is a useful but imprecise label for the philosophical traditions of Asia — primarily India, China, Japan, and Korea. These traditions are as diverse among themselves as Western philosophy: the metaphysics of Advaita Vedanta has as little in common with Confucianism as Plato has with Marx. What unites them, to the extent they are unified, is a shared cultural geography east of the Mediterranean and (in most cases) a different relationship between philosophy, religion, and practical life.

In Eastern philosophy, the boundaries between philosophy, religion, and what we in the West would call spirituality or meditation practice tend to be porous. The Indian philosopher who works through the implications of the Upanishads is simultaneously doing metaphysics, theology, and spiritual practice. This integration of theory and practice, of intellectual inquiry and contemplative transformation, is one of Eastern philosophy's most characteristic and attractive features.

## Indian Philosophy

Indian philosophy is treated in depth in the article on [Indian Philosophy](article.html?id=indian-philosophy). Here we note its major streams:

### The Vedic and Upanishadic Tradition

The oldest layer of Indian philosophy is embedded in the **Vedas** (c. 1500–900 BC) and the **Upanishads** (c. 800–200 BC) — philosophical dialogues exploring the nature of **Brahman** (ultimate reality) and **Ātman** (the individual self). The Upanishads' great declaration, *tat tvam asi* — "That thou art" — identifies the individual self with ultimate reality.

### The Six Orthodox Schools

Classical Indian philosophy recognized six **āstika** (orthodox, accepting the authority of the Vedas) schools:

| School       | Key Concern                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Nyāya        | Logic and epistemology                    |
| Vaiśeṣika    | Metaphysics and atomism                   |
| Sāṃkhya      | Dualism of matter and consciousness       |
| Yoga         | Practice of mental discipline             |
| Mīmāṃsā      | Hermeneutics of Vedic ritual              |
| Vedānta      | Interpretation of the Upanishads; ultimate reality |

**Vedānta** is the most philosophically rich and influential of these schools. Its three great sub-schools debate the relationship between Brahman (ultimate reality) and the individual soul: **Advaita** (non-dualism, Shankara — they are identical); **Viśiṣṭādvaita** (qualified non-dualism, Ramanuja — the soul is real but united with God); **Dvaita** (dualism, Madhva — God and soul are genuinely distinct).

### Buddhism

**Buddhism** originated in India with **Siddhartha Gautama** (the Buddha, ~563–483 BC) and spread across Asia in two major branches: **Theravada** (SE Asia) and **Mahayana** (East Asia, Tibet). Buddhist philosophy is extraordinarily sophisticated, encompassing epistemology, logic, philosophy of mind, and ethics. Key Buddhist philosophical contributions include:

- **Anātman** (no-self): there is no permanent, unchanging self — the "self" is a conventional designation for a stream of constantly changing physical and mental events
- **Śūnyatā** (emptiness, Nagarjuna): all things are "empty" of inherent, independent existence; they exist only in dependence on other things
- **Consciousness-only** (Yogācāra school): the external world as conventionally known is a construct of consciousness

## Chinese Philosophy

For the full treatment see [Chinese Philosophy](article.html?id=chinese-philosophy). The great Chinese schools are:

**Confucianism** — centered on virtue (*rén*, humaneness), right relationship, ritual propriety, and social harmony. Confucianism provided the ethical and political framework for East Asian civilization for over two millennia.

**Taoism** — centered on the *Tao* (the Way), *wu wei* (non-striving action), and attunement to nature. The *Tao Te Ching* and *Zhuangzi* are among the most beautiful and elusive philosophical texts in any language.

**Chan/Zen Buddhism** — the Chinese and Japanese form of Buddhism that emphasizes direct meditative experience over doctrinal learning. The paradoxical koan — "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" — is designed to break through rational conceptualization to a direct insight (*satori*) into reality.

## Japanese Philosophy

Japan received Chinese philosophy (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism) and developed them in distinctive directions. **Zen Buddhism** became central to Japanese culture, shaping martial arts, tea ceremony, poetry, architecture, and aesthetics. The ideal of *mushin* (no-mind) — effortless, non-self-conscious action — influenced the samurai code of **Bushido**.

**Shinto** — Japan's indigenous spiritual tradition — regards nature as sacred and imbued with *kami* (divine spirits or powers). While not a systematic philosophy, Shinto shaped Japanese aesthetics and the sense of harmony between humans and the natural world.

**Nishida Kitaro** (1870–1945) was Japan's first major philosopher to engage systematically with Western philosophy, developing a distinctive account of "pure experience" and "absolute nothingness" that sought to articulate the insight of Zen in philosophical terms.

## Eastern Philosophy and Christian Thought

Christian missionaries and scholars have engaged Eastern thought since the Jesuit missions of the 16th–17th centuries — Matteo Ricci in China, Roberto de Nobili in India. This encounter produced creative theological exchange and also sharp disagreement.

From a Christian perspective, Eastern philosophy contains genuine insights — about the nature of consciousness, the unity of reality, the dangers of ego and attachment — that are not contrary to but can illuminate the Christian tradition. At the same time, key Eastern doctrines (the denial of a personal Creator-God, the denial of the permanent individual soul, the cyclical rather than linear view of history) differ fundamentally from Christian revelation.

The proper Christian response to Eastern philosophy is neither wholesale rejection nor uncritical embrace but the same careful, charitable, truth-seeking engagement that [Aquinas](article.html?id=aquinas) applied to Aristotle: taking what is true and good, correcting what is false, and weaving it into a larger, truer whole.
