:::summary
Charlemagne (c. 747–814), King of the Franks and first Holy Roman Emperor, united most of Western Europe under his rule for the first time since the fall of Rome. A devout Christian and tireless patron of education and the arts, his reign launched the Carolingian Renaissance and laid the political and cultural foundations upon which medieval European civilization was built.

## Rise of the Carolingians

Charlemagne was the grandson of Charles Martel — the Frankish military leader who had halted the Muslim advance into Western Europe at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD, one of the most consequential battles in Christian history. His father, Pepin the Short, had himself deposed the last Merovingian king and been anointed by Pope Stephen II as the first Carolingian king of the Franks. From his earliest years, then, Charlemagne was formed by the conviction that Frankish kingship and the defense of Christianity were inseparable vocations.

When Pepin died in 768, he divided his kingdom between his two sons, Charlemagne and Carloman. After Carloman's sudden death in 771, Charlemagne became sole ruler of the Frankish kingdom — a vast territory stretching across modern France, Belgium, and western Germany. He was approximately 23 or 24 years old, and he would spend the next four decades reshaping the face of Western civilization.

## Military Campaigns and the Expansion of Christendom

Charlemagne was above all a warrior king, and his reign was marked by almost continuous military campaigning. His wars were rarely mere conquests for plunder; they were campaigns of Christianization and political consolidation.

:::dropdown The Saxon Wars (772–804)
The most brutal and protracted of Charlemagne's campaigns was his conquest of the pagan Saxons in what is now northern Germany. The wars lasted more than thirty years and were marked by fierce resistance. In 782, following a Saxon uprising and the massacre of a Frankish army, Charlemagne ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners at Verden — an act that remains controversial. Yet the ultimate result was the permanent Christianization of Saxony and its integration into the Frankish world. The Saxons became among the most stalwart Christians in medieval Europe, and their region would later produce Luther and the Reformation.

:::dropdown War in Italy and the Papal Alliance
In 773–774, at the request of Pope Adrian I, Charlemagne crossed the Alps and defeated the Lombards who had been threatening Rome, adding the title King of the Lombards to his own. His relationship with the papacy was one of mutual dependence: the popes needed Frankish military protection; Charlemagne needed papal legitimacy. This alliance of throne and altar defined European politics for centuries.

:::dropdown The Spanish March
Charlemagne also pushed into Muslim Spain, establishing the "Spanish March" — a buffer zone south of the Pyrenees. His rearguard was ambushed at the Pass of Roncevaux in 778, resulting in the death of his commander Roland. This defeat was transmuted by legend into the great *Chanson de Roland*, the founding epic of French literature.

## The Imperial Coronation (800 AD)

On Christmas Day, 800 AD, Pope Leo III placed a crown upon Charlemagne's head in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and proclaimed him *Imperator Romanorum* — Emperor of the Romans. The act was startling: there had been no Emperor in the West since 476 AD. Whether Charlemagne was surprised by the coronation (as his biographer Einhard suggests) or had conspired to receive it, the moment was of enormous symbolic importance.

The coronation declared that a new Western Christian empire had arisen — that the political unity of Rome had been reborn under a Christian king. It also created centuries of tension between emperors and popes over who held ultimate authority. But on that Christmas morning, the concept of a unified Christian Europe received its most powerful political expression.

## The Carolingian Renaissance

Charlemagne's legacy is not only military. He was a passionate champion of learning and culture in an age of widespread illiteracy and intellectual darkness. His court at Aachen became the leading center of learning in Western Europe.

:::dropdown Palace School and Education Reform
Charlemagne founded the Palace School at Aachen, attracting the greatest scholars of Europe — most notably the English monk Alcuin of York, who became his chief educational advisor. Charlemagne required that all monasteries and cathedrals establish schools. He promoted literacy among the clergy (many of whom could barely read), standardized Latin as the language of learning, and insisted that the Bible and the liturgy be copied accurately.

He could read Latin (and understood Greek), though he struggled to write — he kept writing tablets under his pillow to practice, according to Einhard. His genuine love of learning, unusual in a warrior king, was one of his most remarkable characteristics.

:::dropdown The Carolingian Minuscule
One of the most practical achievements of the Carolingian Renaissance was the development of Carolingian minuscule — a clear, legible script that replaced the jumbled variety of earlier scripts. This script made books far easier to copy and read, and ultimately became the basis of modern lowercase letters. When Renaissance scholars rediscovered classical texts centuries later, they assumed Carolingian script was the "classical" Roman hand and modeled their own humanist script on it — which is why the letters on this page look as they do.

## Administration and Government

Charlemagne governed his vast empire through a sophisticated administrative system. He divided his territory into counties (*comtes*), each governed by a count who administered justice, collected taxes, and led troops. To prevent the counts from becoming too powerful and independent, he created the *missi dominici* — pairs of royal inspectors (one clerical, one lay) who traveled the empire auditing the counts' performance and relaying the emperor's commands.

He issued a steady stream of *capitularies* — royal decrees covering everything from church discipline to agricultural practices to the treatment of the poor. These reflect a ruler who thought deeply about the organization of Christian society and his own responsibility before God for the welfare of his subjects.

## Faith and Legacy

Charlemagne was a sincere, if sometimes ruthlessly pragmatic, Christian. He attended Mass daily, gave generously to the poor and to churches, and went on pilgrimage. He engaged in theological debates with his court scholars, corresponded with the Pope, and saw himself as a steward of Christendom.

His empire did not long survive him. His son Louis the Pious struggled to maintain unity, and by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the empire was divided among Louis's three sons — the embryonic forms of modern France, Germany, and Italy. But the cultural and spiritual inheritance of Charlemagne endured: the ideal of a unified Christian Europe, the network of cathedral schools, the Carolingian script, and the administrative habits that shaped medieval governance for centuries.

Pope John Paul II, in his 2004 post-synodal exhortation *Ecclesia in Europa*, named Charlemagne among the "founding figures" of European civilization. He is buried at the Cathedral of Aachen, which he built and where he worshiped.
