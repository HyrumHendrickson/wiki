:::notice
**Admin Article** — This guide explains how to add citations and references
to EduWiki articles.
:::

:::summary
Every EduWiki article should cite its sources. Citations are added in a numbered list
at the bottom of the article, and inline references in the body text (like `[1]`)
automatically become clickable superscript links that jump to the citation.
:::

## Why Citations Matter

EduWiki is designed for teaching, and academic integrity is important. Citations:

- **Give credit** to the original authors of ideas and content.
- **Allow readers to verify** facts and explore further.
- **Build trust** in the accuracy of the article.
- **Provide deeper reading** for students who want to learn more.

## The Citations Section

Every article must end with a `:::citations` block:

```
:::citations
1. Author, A. (Year). *Title of Book*. Publisher.
2. Author, B. (Year). "Article Title." *Journal Name*, Vol(Issue), pages.
3. Website Name. [url](https://...)
:::
```

## Inline Citation References

To link a claim in the body text to a specific citation, write `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
EduWiki's JavaScript automatically converts these to clickable superscript links:

```
The Pythagorean theorem was known to Babylonian mathematicians as early as 1800 BC. [1]
The Greek philosopher Pythagoras is credited with the first formal proof. [2]
```

The numbers link to the corresponding entry in the references list at the bottom of the page.
The numbers must match the order of items in your citations block.

## Citation Formats

EduWiki loosely follows APA style. Here are templates for common source types:

:::dropdown Book
```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year).
*Title of book: Subtitle if any* (Edition ed.).
Publisher.
```

**Example:**

```
Stewart, J. (2015). *Calculus: Early Transcendentals* (8th ed.). Cengage Learning.
```
:::

:::dropdown Journal Article
```
Author, A. A. (Year). "Article title."
*Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), page–page.
https://doi.org/xxxxx (if available)
```

**Example:**

```
Robson, E. (2002). "Words and Pictures: New Light on Plimpton 322."
*American Mathematical Monthly*, 109(2), 105–120.
```
:::

:::dropdown Website / Online Resource
```
Author or Organization. (Year, Month Day). *Page title*.
Website Name. [URL](https://url)
```

**Example:**

```
Khan Academy. (2024). *Calculus*.
[khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
```
:::

:::dropdown Video
```
Creator. (Year, Month Day). *Video title* [Video].
Platform. [URL](https://url)
```

**Example:**

```
3Blue1Brown. (2017, April 28). *The Essence of Calculus* [Video].
YouTube. [youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM)
```

## Minimal Citation Requirements

Every article must include:

- At least **one citation** in the references section.
- An inline reference `[1]` wherever a major factual claim is made.
- A link for all online sources.

For admin/help articles, a single citation like "EduWiki internal documentation." is acceptable.

## Complete Example

```
In the body text:

Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz independently developed calculus
in the 17th century. [1] The notation we use today is primarily
due to Leibniz. [2]

At the bottom of the article:

:::citations
1. Boyer, C. B. (1959). *The History of the Calculus and Its
   Conceptual Development*. Dover.
2. Cajori, F. (1929). *A History of Mathematical Notations*.
   Open Court Publishing.
