:::summary
Greek philosophy is the foundation of Western intellectual life — a tradition born in the city-states of ancient Greece around 600 BC, when thinkers first began seeking rational, rather than purely mythological, explanations for the world and the good life. From Thales and the pre-Socratics through Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, to the Stoics and Neo-Platonists, the Greeks asked every fundamental question about reality, knowledge, morality, and beauty that philosophy still wrestles with today. Christian thinkers from Augustine to Aquinas drew deeply from this inheritance, weaving Greek reason into the fabric of Western theology.

## Origins: The Pre-Socratic Philosophers

Greek philosophy began not in Athens but on the Ionian coast of Asia Minor, in the city of Miletus, around 600 BC. The earliest philosophers — called **pre-Socratics** because they preceded Socrates — broke with the mythological tradition by seeking natural explanations for the cosmos.

**Thales of Miletus** (~624–546 BC) is traditionally called the first philosopher. He proposed that water is the fundamental substance underlying all of reality — a bold attempt to explain the unity beneath the diversity of the world. His successors proposed other candidates: Anaximenes chose air; Heraclitus (~535–475 BC) chose fire, famously declaring that "everything flows" (*panta rhei*) — all things are in constant change.

**Pythagoras** (~570–495 BC) founded a religious-philosophical community in southern Italy that identified number as the ultimate reality. His mathematical mysticism influenced Plato deeply and, through Plato, the entire Western tradition.

**Parmenides** (~515–450 BC) challenged common sense: only the One exists; change and multiplicity are illusions. His young contemporary **Zeno of Elea** composed famous paradoxes — Achilles and the tortoise, the flying arrow — to defend this view. Together they forced Greek thinkers to think rigorously about being, change, and infinity.

**Democritus** (~460–370 BC) proposed **atomism**: all of reality is composed of invisible, indivisible particles (atoms, from Greek *a-tomos*, "uncuttable") moving in the void. This extraordinary idea anticipated modern physics by two millennia.

## Socrates and the Socratic Revolution

**Socrates** (~470–399 BC) redirected Greek philosophy from the cosmos to the human soul. Unlike his predecessors, Socrates wrote nothing; we know him through the dialogues of his student Plato and through Xenophon's memoirs. He spent his life in the agora of Athens, engaging citizens in conversation, demonstrating by skillful questioning — the **Socratic method** — that most people do not actually know the things they claim to know.

"The unexamined life is not worth living."

Socrates taught that **virtue is knowledge**: to know the good is to do the good, and vice arises only from ignorance. He was famously tried and executed by the Athenian democracy in 399 BC, charged with impiety and corrupting the youth — a martyrdom that haunted his student Plato and shaped the entire subsequent tradition.

The Socratic method — of persistent, humble questioning to expose hidden assumptions and contradictions — remains the most powerful pedagogical tool in philosophy and law.

## Plato: The World of Forms

**Plato** (~428–348 BC) is arguably the most influential philosopher who ever lived. Alfred North Whitehead famously described all of Western philosophy as "a series of footnotes to Plato." Plato recorded the conversations of Socrates in a series of brilliant literary dialogues and developed his own positive philosophy out of that inheritance.

### The Theory of Forms

Plato's most distinctive doctrine is the **Theory of Forms** (or Ideas). The world of the senses — the world of tables, trees, and beautiful faces — is a world of flux and imperfection, always becoming but never fully *being*. Behind the sensory world lies a realm of eternal, immaterial, perfect **Forms**: the Form of Justice, the Form of Beauty, the Form of the Good. The things we see are real only insofar as they *participate* in these Forms.

The **Form of the Good** stands at the top of the hierarchy of Forms — the ultimate source of being and intelligibility. Plato identified it with the divine. Christian thinkers, especially [Augustine](article.html?id=augustine), would later identify the Form of the Good with God Himself.

:::dropdown The Allegory of the Cave
In the *Republic*, Plato describes prisoners chained in a cave, able to see only shadows cast on the wall by objects behind them, which they mistake for reality. One prisoner escapes, ascends into the sunlight, and sees the world as it truly is — but returns to the cave to free the others, who resent and reject him.

The allegory represents the philosopher's ascent from the shadows of sensory opinion to the light of genuine knowledge (the Forms). The sun represents the Form of the Good. The philosopher-king, who has seen the Good, has a duty to return and govern, even though he would prefer to remain in contemplation.

This allegory is one of the most powerful images in all of philosophy. Augustine read it as a foreshadowing of the soul's ascent to God.

### Plato's Dialogues and Key Works

- ***The Republic*** — political philosophy, the theory of justice, education, and the philosopher-king
- ***The Phaedo*** — the immortality of the soul; Socrates' final hours before drinking hemlock
- ***The Symposium*** — the nature of love (eros); the ascent from physical to divine beauty
- ***Timaeus*** — cosmology; the Demiurge (divine craftsman) who fashions the world according to the Forms
- ***Meno*** — can virtue be taught? the theory of recollection (knowledge as remembrance of the Forms)

## Aristotle: The Master of Those Who Know

**Aristotle** (~384–322 BC), Plato's greatest student, broke with his teacher on almost every fundamental point while remaining deeply indebted to him. Dante called him *il maestro di color che sanno* — "the master of those who know." He was tutor to the young [Alexander the Great](article.html?id=alexander-the-great) and founded his own school, the **Lyceum**, in Athens.

Where Plato located ultimate reality in an immaterial realm of Forms, Aristotle insisted that reality is this world — individual substances, each with their own **form** (structure) and **matter** (stuff). Aristotle was an empiricist: knowledge begins with the senses.

### Logic and the Organon

Aristotle invented formal logic. His *Organon* (meaning "instrument" or "tool") laid out a complete system of deductive inference based on the **syllogism**: if "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man," then "Socrates is mortal." Aristotelian logic dominated Western thought for two thousand years and remains indispensable.

### Metaphysics and the Unmoved Mover

In his *Metaphysics*, Aristotle argued for the existence of an **Unmoved Mover** — an eternal, perfect being of pure thought (*noesis noeseos*, "thought thinking itself") that is the ultimate cause of all motion in the universe without itself being moved. [Aquinas](article.html?id=aquinas) would later identify this Unmoved Mover with the Christian God in his famous Five Ways.

### Ethics and Eudaimonia

Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* is the foundational text of **virtue ethics**. The goal of human life, Aristotle argued, is **eudaimonia** — a word usually translated "happiness" but better rendered as "human flourishing." Eudaimonia is not a feeling but an activity: the activity of living and acting in accordance with **virtue** (*arete*).

Virtues are stable character traits — courage, justice, temperance, practical wisdom — acquired by habit and practice. Virtue is always a **mean** between two extremes: courage is the mean between cowardice and recklessness; generosity is the mean between miserliness and prodigality.

## The Hellenistic Schools

After Alexander's conquests spread Greek culture across the Mediterranean world, philosophy splintered into competing schools focused on the question of how to live a good life.

### Stoicism

**Stoicism** was founded by Zeno of Citium (~334–262 BC) and became the dominant philosophy of educated Romans. The Stoics taught that virtue alone is good; external things (health, wealth, reputation) are "indifferent." The good person is the one whose will is wholly aligned with **logos** — the divine rational principle ordering the cosmos. See [Stoicism](article.html?id=stoicism) and [Marcus Aurelius](article.html?id=marcus-aurelius).

### Epicureanism

**Epicurus** (~341–270 BC) taught that the goal of life is **ataraxia** — tranquility, freedom from fear and pain. True pleasure is not sensual indulgence but the quiet pleasure of friendship, modest living, and philosophical reflection. The Epicureans believed the gods are indifferent to human affairs, and that death is simply the cessation of sensation — nothing to fear.

### Skepticism

The **Skeptics** (Pyrrho, Sextus Empiricus) argued that no knowledge is possible and that the appropriate response is the suspension of judgment (*epoché*) — which they believed led to tranquility.

## Neo-Platonism and the Christian Inheritance

**Plotinus** (205–270 AD) founded **Neo-Platonism**, the last great school of ancient philosophy and the one with the most direct influence on Christian theology. In his *Enneads*, Plotinus described reality as emanating in a great cascade from the transcendent, ineffable **One** — through Intellect (nous) and Soul — down to matter, the lowest level of being.

[Augustine of Hippo](article.html?id=augustine) read the Neo-Platonists just before his conversion to Christianity, and found in them almost everything that the Bible taught — except the Incarnation. Neo-Platonic categories — the One, Intellect, Soul, participation, emanation — flowed into Christian theology and shaped the way the Church Fathers articulated the doctrine of God, creation, and the soul's return to its source.
