        <strong>Summary</strong>
        Clive Staples Lewis (1898–1963) was a British author, Oxford don, and one of the most
        influential Christian writers of the 20th century. A former atheist who was converted to
        Christianity in part through conversations with J.R.R. Tolkien, Lewis became a brilliant
        defender of rational Christian faith. His works — from <em>Mere Christianity</em> to
        <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> — have profoundly influenced millions of readers,
        including many Latter-day Saints.

      <h2>From Atheism to Christianity</h2>
      <p>
        Lewis grew up in a nominally religious household but became an atheist as a teenager.
        He served in World War I, then studied at Oxford, where he became a Fellow and tutor.
        Through years of intellectual struggle — reading Christian philosophers like George
        MacDonald, discussing faith with J.R.R. Tolkien, and following the logic of his own
        arguments — Lewis was converted to theism in 1929 and to Christianity in 1931.
      </p>
      <p>
        He later described his conversion as being "the most dejected and reluctant convert in
        all England" — God closing in on him from every intellectual direction until he could no
        longer honestly refuse to believe. His intellectual journey is described in his
        autobiography, <em>Surprised by Joy</em> (1955).

          <p>
            Originally a series of BBC radio broadcasts during World War II, <em>Mere Christianity</em>
            is Lewis's systematic defense of basic Christian faith, aimed at thoughtful non-believers.
            Key arguments include the <strong>Moral Law argument</strong> (the existence of a universal
            moral sense points to a moral Lawgiver) and the famous <strong>"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord"</strong>
            trilemma: Jesus was either a great deceiver, a madman, or exactly who He claimed to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Latter-day Saints have found <em>Mere Christianity</em> helpful as an introduction
            to rational Christian apologetics, while recognizing that it stops short of the restored
            gospel's fullness.

        </button>
        <div class="wiki-dropdown-body">
          <p>
            A satirical masterpiece told from the perspective of a senior devil (Screwtape) writing
            letters of advice to his junior devil nephew (Wormwood) on how to tempt a human "patient."
            The book brilliantly exposes how temptation works — through distraction, gradual
            compromise, and the subtle corruption of good things — making it as practically useful
            today as when it was written.

            Seven novels set in the magical land of Narnia, where the great lion <strong>Aslan</strong>
            — a Christ figure — rules and redeems. Lewis used fantasy to communicate theological
            truths in a way that could reach children and adults who might be resistant to direct
            religious argument. The death and resurrection of Aslan in <em>The Lion, the Witch and
            the Wardrobe</em> is one of the most moving depictions of the Atonement in modern fiction.

      <h2>Lewis and the "Longing" Argument (Sehnsucht)</h2>
      <p>
        One of Lewis's most distinctive and powerful arguments for the existence of God is the
        argument from <strong>desire</strong>, or <em>Sehnsucht</em> (the German word for a deep
        longing or yearning). Lewis observed that human beings have a persistent longing for
        something no earthly thing can satisfy — a joy that is "the inconsolable longing" for
        we know not what.
      </p>
      <p>
        His argument: "If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the
        only logical explanation is that I was made for another world." This resonates powerfully
        with Latter-day Saint doctrine that we are eternal beings who lived before this life with
        our Heavenly Father, and that our homesickness for the divine is literally a memory.
      </p>

      <h2>C.S. Lewis and Latter-day Saint Thought</h2>
      <p>
        C.S. Lewis is widely read and admired among Latter-day Saints. Several of his theological
        intuitions — while coming from a different tradition — strikingly parallel LDS doctrine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Theosis / Becoming like God:</strong> In <em>Mere Christianity</em>, Lewis writes: "The command 'Be ye perfect' is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command." This echoes LDS doctrine of eternal progression.</li>
        <li><strong>A personal, accessible God:</strong> Lewis rejected abstract philosophical deism and insisted on a God who is personal, responsive, and genuinely loves each person.</li>
        <li><strong>The reality of the afterlife:</strong> Lewis took heaven and hell literally and seriously — not as metaphors but as real destinations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Latter-day Saint scholars and leaders have frequently quoted Lewis. Elder Neal A. Maxwell
        and others found his apologetic approach deeply compatible with restored gospel principles.
