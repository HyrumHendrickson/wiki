## Early Life and Education

Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at Shadwell plantation in the Virginia colony. From an early age he displayed an insatiable appetite for learning, studying Latin, Greek, and French, mastering mathematics and science, and reading voraciously in history and philosophy. He entered the College of William & Mary at sixteen and studied law under George Wythe, one of America's foremost legal minds.

Jefferson's classical education gave him deep familiarity with the great thinkers of antiquity — [Aristotle](article.html?id=aristotle), [Cicero](article.html?id=cicero), and the Stoic philosophers — whose ideas about natural law and human dignity permeate his greatest writings.

## Author of the Declaration of Independence

When the Continental Congress needed someone to draft a formal statement of American principles in the summer of 1776, Jefferson's pen was the obvious choice. The resulting [Declaration of Independence](article.html?id=declaration-of-independence) is one of the most consequential documents in human history — a proclamation grounded in the conviction that human rights come not from government, but from God:

> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

This sentence synthesizes centuries of Christian natural theology, Ciceronian jurisprudence, and English constitutional thought into a single revolutionary claim. Jefferson drew on John Locke's [natural law](article.html?id=natural-law) philosophy and the broader tradition of [Western philosophy](article.html?id=western-philosophy) to build an argument that no legitimate government may strip from any human being what God has given.

:::dropdown Jefferson's Philosophical Sources
Jefferson was steeped in the intellectual currents of the Enlightenment but anchored in classical and Christian thought:

- **[John Locke](article.html?id=john-locke)** (*Two Treatises of Government*, 1689): Government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed; when it violates natural rights, the people may alter or abolish it.
- **Cicero** (*De Re Publica*, *De Legibus*): Natural law is universal, written by God into human reason; no human law that contradicts it is truly binding.
- **Algernon Sidney**: Parliamentary and republican principles of resistance to tyranny.
- **Scottish Enlightenment** (Hutcheson, Reid): Moral sense philosophy emphasizing that all persons share an equal moral standing.

Jefferson synthesized these sources and gave them an American voice.

## Presidency and Major Achievements

Jefferson served two terms as President (1801–1809) and his administration produced achievements of lasting consequence:

| Achievement | Year | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Louisiana Purchase | 1803 | Doubled the size of the United States |
| Lewis & Clark Expedition | 1804–1806 | Opened the American West to settlement |
| Abolition of slave trade | 1807 | Signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves |
| Reduction of national debt | 1801–1809 | Cut debt nearly in half through fiscal discipline |

His approach to the presidency was guided by republican simplicity — he walked to his own inauguration, shook hands rather than bowing, and dismantled the quasi-monarchical ceremonial practices of the previous administrations.

## Founder of the University of Virginia

Jefferson considered the founding of the [University of Virginia](article.html?id=us-history) (1819) among his greatest achievements — he listed it, along with authoring the Declaration of Independence and Virginia's Statute for Religious Freedom, on his tombstone. He designed its distinctive Academical Village, modeled on the Pantheon in Rome, to embody the Enlightenment ideal that knowledge is the foundation of republican self-government.

His vision was that a free people required educated citizens, and that the liberal arts — philosophy, history, science, rhetoric, and mathematics — were the proper curriculum for forming free men and women.

## Jefferson and Christianity

Jefferson's religious views were complex. He professed belief in God as Creator, in Providence, and in the moral teachings of Jesus, but was skeptical of organized institutional Christianity and the supernatural miracles of Scripture. He produced the so-called "Jefferson Bible," a distillation of the Gospels focusing on the moral teachings of Christ. Historians debate how to characterize his faith — he himself said his religious views were between himself and God.

Whatever his personal theology, Jefferson's founding vision was deeply shaped by Christian presuppositions: that God created human beings with dignity and rights, that moral truth is knowable by reason, and that tyranny is a sin against God's design.

## Legacy

Thomas Jefferson's legacy is vast, contested, and irreplaceable. He gave voice to America's founding creed with an eloquence that has never been surpassed. His contradictions — an advocate of liberty who owned slaves, a champion of the common man who lived as an aristocrat — are part of the honest story of a nation striving to live up to its own ideals. The arc of American history bends toward the fulfillment of the promise Jefferson articulated: that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights.
