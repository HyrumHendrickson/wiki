:::summary
The French Revolution (1789–1799) was the violent upheaval that toppled the French monarchy, executed thousands in the Reign of Terror, and ultimately gave rise to Napoleon Bonaparte — a decade that transformed Europe and posed the most urgent political and philosophical questions about liberty, order, and the nature of government. Unlike the American founding, which was rooted in Christian natural law and constitutional prudence, the French Revolution was driven by a secular, rationalist ideology that produced unprecedented bloodshed and ultimately delivered tyranny in place of freedom.

## Background and Causes

By 1789, France was in acute crisis. The royal treasury was bankrupt after decades of expensive wars — including France's support for the American Revolution. The tax burden fell almost entirely on the peasantry and middle class while the nobility and clergy enjoyed traditional exemptions. Harvests had failed repeatedly, bread prices soared, and ordinary people were hungry.

Into this combustible situation came the ideas of the French Enlightenment — Voltaire's anti-clericalism, Rousseau's "general will," and the rhetoric of natural rights drawn loosely from thinkers like [John Locke](article.html?id=john-locke). These ideas provided intellectual fuel for grievances that were already at a boiling point.

## The Revolution Unfolds

:::dropdown 1789 — The Revolution Begins
In May 1789, King Louis XVI convened the Estates-General — a parliamentary body that had not met since 1614 — to address the fiscal crisis. The Third Estate (commoners) demanded voting by head rather than by order. When the king resisted, the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, vowing not to disperse until France had a constitution.

On July 14, 1789, a Parisian mob stormed the Bastille fortress-prison, a symbol of royal tyranny. The revolution had begun. The National Assembly abolished feudalism, issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and began drafting a constitution.

:::dropdown The Constitutional Monarchy (1789–1792)
France briefly operated as a constitutional monarchy, but the king's attempted flight to Austria in 1791 destroyed public trust in Louis XVI. War with Austria and Prussia began in 1792 as European monarchies grew alarmed at revolutionary France. Military setbacks fueled paranoia about traitors and counter-revolutionaries within France.

:::dropdown The Reign of Terror (1793–1794)
The most infamous phase of the Revolution was the Reign of Terror, directed by the Committee of Public Safety under Maximilien Robespierre. In the name of "liberty" and the "republic," approximately 17,000 people were officially executed by guillotine — including King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and eventually Robespierre himself. Tens of thousands more died in prisons or were killed in the brutal pacification of the Vendée, where Catholic royalists rose in revolt and were massacred.

The Terror was the logical consequence of a revolution built on abstract ideology rather than the Christian understanding of human nature. When "virtue" becomes a political program enforced by the state, and when God and transcendent moral law are removed from the picture, the guillotine is never far behind.

:::dropdown Napoleon and the End of the Revolution (1795–1799)
After the fall of Robespierre, the more moderate Directory governed France with increasing corruption and instability. In 1799, the young general Napoleon Bonaparte staged a coup (*18 Brumaire*) and established himself as First Consul, then Emperor. Napoleon ended the Revolution but preserved many of its legal innovations — the Napoleonic Code — while restoring strong central authority.

## The American and French Revolutions Compared

The contrast between the American and French Revolutions is one of the most instructive lessons in political philosophy:

| Feature | American Revolution | French Revolution |
|---|---|---|
| Intellectual foundation | Christian natural law (Locke, [Cicero](article.html?id=cicero)) | Secular rationalism (Rousseau, Voltaire) |
| Attitude toward religion | Religion protected and honored | Church attacked; "de-Christianization" campaigns |
| Violence | Relatively restrained | Mass executions; Reign of Terror |
| Outcome | Stable constitutional republic | Chaos, then dictatorship |
| Founding documents | [Declaration](article.html?id=declaration-of-independence), [Constitution](article.html?id=constitution) | Successive constitutions, none durable |

The American founders understood, as Edmund Burke observed from England, that liberty without order and moral foundations does not produce freedom — it produces anarchy and then tyranny. The French revolutionaries, drunk on abstract ideology, learned this the hard way.

## Legacy and Influence

The French Revolution permanently transformed European politics:

- It abolished feudalism and the legal privileges of the aristocracy across Europe
- Napoleon's conquests spread the Napoleonic Code, transforming law across the continent
- It inspired nationalist movements across Latin America and Europe
- It gave the world the terms "left" and "right" (from seating in the National Assembly)
- It demonstrated, with terrible clarity, what happens when a civilization abandons its Christian roots in the name of "Reason"

The Revolution's legacy is deeply ambiguous: it produced genuine legal modernization alongside mass murder, and its rhetoric of liberty was used to justify the worst tyrannies of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its most important lesson may be this: liberty grounded in God-given rights is durable; liberty grounded only in human ideology is fragile.
